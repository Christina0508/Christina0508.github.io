        <p>​    Talk about my biggest academic achievement ,I’d like to describe an exam in my junior high school which I ranked the twentieth among eight hundred students in my school.</p>
<p>​    As Chinese tradition,to be a good student , the most important thing is getting high marks in the exams,that is because in China,the end of the junior high school exams are the only and the most important factor for the entrance of senior high school.In this way, at that time for me the most important thing is to get high marks in the exams and my dream is of course is to do well in the exams and get into a good senior high school.</p>
<p>​    I’d like to talk about one of the mid-term exams.Before that exam,I did very bad in some previous exams,that makes me feel afraid of that exam.I could not come up with the answer why I couldn’t get high marks in the exams.During that period,I felt annoyed about myself.Why I make low level mistakes frequently?I worked very hard ,but I just couldn’t’t stop myself from making stupid mistakes.I thought that I couldn’t overcome that time.In this way,I felt even nervous when the exam was going to begin.I found that my heart speed up and just like there was a deer running fast in my heart.When the teacher came into the classroom, I even felt my hand which held the pen was trembling.I was afraid that I would get a bad mark again.</p>
<p>​    I needed to calm down,so I just told myself to calm down and I could achieve the goal and I could get high marks.I repeated these words in my heart and tried to give myself confidence.This way helped me and I calm down slowly and decided to try my best during the exam.That was the maths exam and I had make a lot of stupid mistakes in maths exam.I could work out the hard question, but I just went wrong in simple questions.So this time,I tried very hard and reminded myself to be careful and calm down many times.I thought that I put all my energy on that exam and i felt a stone in my heart went down and I was tired out when the exam finished.</p>
<p>​    Luckily,I got a high mark in that exams and I have a high rank.However,I don’t think that that success was because of my fortune and I also don’t want to say that success was because of my efforts.Admittedly,my efforts was one of the factor,but the most essential factor was the confidence.Through this success, I have learned that the only problem was in my heart.I wanted to get a good result in a haste and this made me made too many simple mistakes.Another reason is that I was not confident enough,because of the previous failure and I even couldn’t believe that I have the capacity to get success in the exams .</p>
<p>​    I thought this was my biggest academic achievement not because I have got a good rank and high marks in that exams.In fact, this was only a small exam,as it was not important and cannot decide my future and make small influence to me.However,during that event,I have found the weakness of my study life and I could not overcome it for a long time.That was the first time I have beat it.So this have told me that I could overcome it, and nothing is possible if i try and find a right method.Although I haven’t beat it forever and in fact I have met such similar occasions for many times since I got success in that exam.I thought that was due to my own personality and one ‘s personality is not easy to change.But this does not matter at all, i could try over and over again,i could overcome it forever in the future someday because definitely I will find an appropriate and effective way.</p>
