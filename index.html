<p>title:  Summary about my drawing courses<br>date: 2020-08-22 19:47:43<br>tags: Drawing during summer holiday<br>I have kept drawing since I was only a little girl. I always kept drawing as one hobby for myself and I always sticked to this hobby until I entered the ninth grade.</p>
<p>When I entered the eighth grade, I was very busy with my study and I not only had to have many courses in the school, but also need to take extra courses during the free time. As a result, I didn’t keep my frequency to go drawing courses once a week and I only went to there through the frequency of about two weeks once or even three weeks once. In this way, obviously, I didn’t get much practice and I became even lazier after that year. Since I entered the ninth grade and I became much busier of my study and I even couldn’t find any time to go drawing. Then, a second time I found one excuse for myself. I told myself that I would go and attend the courses if I could find any time free. However, the fact is that i found more time to finish my homework, my efficiency is lower than before I was. As a result, I couldn’t find any time free to attend the courses.</p>
<p>During this summer holiday, I haven’t taken any courses in the last one year and I found the students around me all have their hobbies. Then, I realized that I should have my own hobby as well. I decided to pick up my hobby and took the drawing courses and always sticked to it. So, I tried to finish my work and found some time to take the courses. However, when I took the course for the first time and then I felt that it was really struggling for me to draw as before, as I have forgotten about the skills I learnt before and it couldn’t find any fulfillment from the course again. I had an idea to give up it and I didn’t to waste my time anymore. However, my teacher told me that if i tried to practice for some lessons, I would find that It didn’t forget about anything, I just haven’t practiced it for a long time. As I have learned it for so many years before, I have a very good basic training and it will be very simple for me to pick up it very soon.</p>
<p>Then, a really amazing thing happened during the second lesson. When I just drawn myself during that lesson. This maybe something that seems to be unbelievable, but it was true that I suddenly learned that how to draw ,which meant I suddenly understand the method to draw and I even just know how to draw before, but I never understood that why I draw in that way. I thought that maybe this was because I have grown up even older and it has become very easy for me to draw. Just after several lessons, I found that the senescent when I drew before.</p>
<p>During this experience, I decided that I would stick to my hobby in the future even if I will be really busy with my study, I thought that maybe I could understand the meaning quicker if I didn’t give up it for one year. I think it’s a truth for all the matters, insistence is always important for everyone, I will remember it no matter I will do anything in the future.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddVDuq.jpg" alt="ddVDuq.jpg"><br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddZ9Vf.jpg" alt="ddZ9Vf.jpg"></p>

<p>title: My first IELTS speaking test<br>date: 2020-08-17 15:24:28<br>tags: the feeling of the first speaking test</p>
<p>I’d like to describe my first IELTS speaking test. I have prepared for my IELTS test for a long time. </p>
<p>Although I have taking several mock tests, I haven’t tried a real one before. In addition, there’s a huge difference between the mock exam and the real exam. First, it’s really official and I didn’t know the process of the test before. Second,    I have never had one speaking mock test before with one foreign teacher, so it’s easy for me to feel very nervous. Plus, this time I have to take this exam in the morning, so there’s less time for me to do psychological construction.</p>
<p>When I got the test center, the process of the exam was so complex, and I was frightened by that. I felt really nervous since I just got into the university where I took the test. I felt that a deer was running in my heart and I felt really bad. In order to let me calm down, I thought I have to do some measures. First, when I got in, I told myself that I can do it, there is no need for me to be afraid of this test, the foreign teachers just the same as Chinese teachers and they are all friendly. I just to have one talk with him not a test at all. I could calm down for some while. However, when I got into the building, all the students were followed the guidance of the teacher to sit outdoor of the classroom where you would take the test. All the students were waiting there until the examiner called them. I waited there for some while and all the students have been in the classroom. This is only me who still sited on the corridor and then the sense of fear came to me again. This time the way to talk to myself was not available. Then, I overcome one new idea immediately. I let myself to take several deep breaths and just look at the floor not the door. In this way, it really helps me slow down my heartbeat. </p>
<p>As a result, although I couldn’t let myself be calm as I am during the normal days, I could let myself not to be too nervous which would influence my condition during the speaking test. I still felt a little bit nervous during the test, but this didn’t matter too much. I could give out my opinion and talk to the examiner quite fluently. I think that maybe a little bit tension can help me do better in the test.</p>
<p>I think that although I haven’t known the score I got, I think this test is still meaningful for me. This is the first time I have one speaking test, I’ve developed some tips to help me overcome the psychological problems. I think that the most important isn’t that I got the ways to help myself, but to get the idea that I can overcome all the problems if I try my best. This time if I didn’t help myself, I couldn’t say a word to the examiner just because I’m afraid. If I meet some difficulties in the life, I have to try to overcome and solve it, not to try to escape it. Always try is the best solution.</p>

[Photo/Sipa]<br>China’s fiscal revenue, which reported its first growth this year in June, returned to expansionary territory, enabling stronger fiscal support for the economy over the second half, experts said on Friday.<br>The government’s general budgeted revenue grew by 3.2 percent year-on-year last month, marking the first expansion this year, thanks to the recovery in business activity and imports, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.<br>Fiscal revenue has been in a rally since the second quarter of the year as the economy staged comeback growth from the shutdowns brought by the COVID-19 outbreak, said Liu Jinyun, an official with the ministry.<br>Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter, according to Liu.<br>The year-on-year slide in the value-added tax revenue, the biggest contributor to the country’s national coffer, narrowed by 19.1 percent for the January-June period, versus 23.6 percent for the first three months as production activities in the industrial sector continued to recover, Liu said.<br>“The positive growth in fiscal revenue is a reflection of the nation’s steady economic recovery as well as the stable operation of market entities,” said Yang Weiyong, an associate professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.<br>With the economy continuing to recover in the second half, fiscal revenue is expected to further rise and increase funds available for the government to support the economy, Yang said.<br>The country reported a 1.6 percent year-on-year contraction in GDP for the first half of the year on Thursday, recovering from the 6.8 percent plunge for the first quarter, while analysts expect China’s economic growth to come in at about 2 to 3 percent for the whole year.<br>Luo Zhiheng, former chief macroeconomic researcher at the Evergrande Research Institute, said the proactive fiscal policy has played a key role in facilitating the economic recovery, with targeted tax and fee cuts and relatively strong fiscal expenditure focused on combating the contagion, ensuring people’s livelihood and funding major construction projects.<br>The country’s fiscal spending in the first six months fell by 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 11.64 trillion yuan, slower than the drop in revenue, according to the ministry.Looking into the second half, Luo said the country is expected to accelerate fiscal spending and shore up domestic demand, with the recovery in fiscal revenue and money raised by government<br>bonds providing more funds.<br>China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month, the ministry said.<br>The country has also stepped up the issuance of the projected 3.75 trillion yuan worth of special local government bonds, which are mainly to fund infrastructure investment. A total of 2.24 trillion yuan worth of the bonds were issued as of Tuesday, with 85 percent of the money raised already be spent, the ministry said.<br>“The Chinese economy still faces the risk that the global spread of COVID-19 may hit external demand, threatening employment and the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises.<br>Extending supports to these areas will be the focus of fiscal policy in the coming months,” Luo said.<br>Nonetheless, analysts said it is unlikely that China will elevate the quota of special treasuries, given the need to prevent excessive stimulus from causing risk.<br>“To prevent the distortion in resource allocation, it is more advisable for China to further the tax and fee cut measures than issue more bonds to fund government-led investment,” Yang said.<br>                                            Commentary<br>                     How reducing tax revenue to help recover<br>Because of the rise of the novel coronavirus in the world, the recovery is the most important aim of China, in order to recover, linking to the concept tax which means that a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.I want to discuss whether it’s helpful for recovery and why it offers a helping hand to recover.<br>From the news, we can get that “Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter.”In this way, we can know that the fiscal revenue of the first quarter of 2020 is more than that of the revenue of the second quarter. This may because the indirect tax and direct tax all decreases. Firstly, government gives back some tax to people that are directly charged from their salaries. Secondly, government may also reduce the prices of products especially the prices of<br>necessities. In this way, people will be more affordable for these products. As a result, people can balance their lives during the novel coronavirus.<br>—<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a81iWD.png" alt="a81iWD.png"><br>From Fig1，government imposes a tax on the supply . The supply curve shifts to the left. In addition, many people cannot work during the virus period and some people even lose their jobs, so the demand for people to buy things will decrease because they may prefer to save their money as they have no confidence for the future. The demand curve will also shift to the left. When quantity is certain, the tax revenue is the quantity multiply the price difference, so the tax revenue before the coronavirus is tax revenue 1 which is the dark bule block, and the tax revenue during the virus is the tax revenue 2 which is the light blue block.<br>In July, the fiscal revenue of China showed the first time to recover, this was because the recovery of imports and the recovery of business activity. From the news, we can get that “China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month.” In order to support the further recovery, the government has issued 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries to help state-owned business. Issuing money cannot help recovering very well. Government help these companies, so these companies can continue to produce instead of going bankrupt. This also decreases the costs of the products. As a result, the prices of products will decrease, people will be more affordable for them. The economic growth can grow. However, issuing money cannot help recovering very well, because of the virus, although people can be more affordable for products, they may have no confidence for the future, and they will save the money instead of spending money. As a result, money of government has wasted and has no effects. In this way, there is little help for recovery. In addition, issuing the money may lead the distortion in resource allocation because it’s difficult for the government to estimate how much money to give which sector, so it’s difficult to spend money effectively.<br>From the news, the writer points out that reducing tax revenue is a better way to help recover than issuing the money to help business activities. If government reduces the tax revenue, not only the prices of the products reduce, but also people’s salaries increase (both direct tax and indirect tax). In this way, people will have money to afford products. Although we may face the same problem, that’s people with no confidence about future, government may face a different situation. Imposing tax is a method which is used in the long run. People can’t get much money from tax immediately. As a result, they may choose to save money recently, but they will spend money in long run.<br>In the Fig2, if government reduces the tax revenue, people will have the incentives to buy things. In this way, people’s demand will increase, so the demand curve shifts to the right.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/a813lQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a813lQ.png" alt="a813lQ.png"></a><br>In conclusion, issuing the money is easy to get to lead the distortion in resource allocation, so reduce tax revenue may be is a more reasonable method to help recovery. However, is very difficult for people to get much money through reducing the tax, so in long run this method may be is a good way to help recovery.</p>

<p>title:  Stage summary from 7.1 to 7.20<br>date: 2020-07-24 21:36:49<br>tags: Stage summary from 7.1 to 7.20<br>I would like to describe my life in these twenty days, the following summary includes three parts.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to talk about my results in these days. First of all, in my IELTS study, I continued to do exercises three times a week. I thought this part was normal because I did these exercises as usual. I will have a real IELTS test next month, so I’m preparing for it. During these days, I haven’t found any efforts in my points, I find that I may feel tired because of the longtime exercises, so I have to adjust myself to a better condition. In this way, maybe I can get a better point next month. Secondly, in my school study, I have done some preview sections, I have previewed three chapters of Chemistry, one chapter of Physics and two chapters of Math (Pure1). I have also had two economic lessons and one easy- commentary about a piece of news. Then, I have updated my blog once a week. In addition, I also had three python lessons every week to continue my coding part.</p>
<p>Then, I’d like to talk about my plan of next twenty days. The most important thing is to pass my IELTS test, I hope this part can be finished soon. I don’t want to delay it for so long time. This will let me more tired and more difficult to pass it. I plan to memory more words to help me cope with speaking and wring part. Next, I plan to continue preview next term’s books. My plan is to preview two chapters of each subject and I think I have to do some exercises. During last twenty days, I haven’t done many exercises because I haven’t learned much about new book. However, I think it’s really an important part of my preview part. In addition, I think I will write another commentary about news next twenty days after taking some lessons. Exercises can help me to consolidate the knowledge, this will help me to do better next term. Then, I plan to continue updating my blog once a week. I will also continue to have python lessons every week. Then, I think I will have a new part next twenty days, I think I will have some activities to enrich myself.</p>
<p>Summer holiday is one essential part for one year. I have done much in these twenty days and I hope I can do better in next twenties. I think I can plan and control my time in more effective way because actually I have wasted much time in this twenty days.</p>

<p>title: Commentary<br>date: 2020-07-18 14:50:52<br>tags: Comentary about one article(news)<br>Source of the article: <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn</a><br>Date the commentary written:  July 18, 2020<br>Words count of the commentary: 927 words<br>Unit of the syllabus to which the article relates: Microeconomics<br>Key concepts: scarcity, shortage and economic well-being<br>                                                                                Article<br>                                                           Water quenches thirst for growth<br>By Fang Aiqing in Beijing and Hu Dongmei in Pengyang, Ningxia | China Daily | Updated: 2020-06-13 09:14<br> Over the past decade, Ningxia has been prioritizing the resolution to provide rural areas with safe drinking water. Reliable supply transforms once barren area into a hive of productivity and profit.</p>
<p>With the help of automation and smart technology, residents of one of China’s driest areas are getting affordable clean water instead of yearning for rainfall.</p>
<p>It took people living in the central and south of Ningxia Hui autonomous region nearly 40 years to complete this arduous journey.</p>
<p>“In the past, we had to pour the water into the jar and let it settle before drinking it,” says Li Xiaoqin, a villager at Chengyang village of Pengyang county in the southeast of the autonomous region.<br>Zhang Shixiang, Party secretary of the village, says they used to carry water two kilometers to home, and it took two hours just to get the water.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have drinking water, let alone water to shower,” Li says, adding that they now have tap water not only to drink and shower, but also to clean the house, water the flowers, feed livestock, and importantly, flush the toilet.<br> Experts from the Ministry of Water Resources visit Pengyang county in the southeast of the autonomous region. </p>
<p>Today, the nearly 200,000 people living in the countryside of Pengyang, can, through phone access, check water quality and pay fees. Crucially, water charges are the same as those for townsfolk.</p>
<p>The southern mountainous area of the autonomous region, including where the county is located, is often referred to as Xihaigu.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, it was a dry and rainless place where barren hills stretched on and on and ravines and gullies crisscrossed. Groundwater was scarce.</p>
<p>Water resource per capita was less than one-sixth of the average amount nationwide, according to Jiang Qi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and director of the institute for desertification control at the Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences.</p>
<p>Scarcity of water had once been a constraint for the region’s high-quality development, he says.<br>A regional government document on poverty alleviation released in September 2016 shows that rain-fed farming accounted for 90 percent of total farmlands in underdeveloped areas of the autonomous region, and 80 percent of the cultivated land yielded not much and unsteadily.</p>
<p>Yet, annual rainfall of the county ranges from 350 to 550 millimeters, around one-third of the amount of evaporation, and rainfall from July through September takes up more than 60 percent of the whole year, making the situation in other seasons even worse, according to a government introduction of Pengyang’s natural geographic features.</p>
<p>However, with a stable water source now, the locals are actively planting red plum apricots (a local specialty), pepper, edible mushrooms and Chinese medical herbs, and also raising chickens, bees, cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>Niu Detan, general manager of the county’s water supply management company, says some locals who used to work outside have come back to run breeding businesses, or operate greenhouses and plant orchards.</p>
<p>People’s income is growing every year, Niu says.<br>All this is thanks to a water transfer project that makes it possible for more than one million people of the Xihaigu area to access safe drinking water since 2016.</p>
<p>The project transfers water from the Jinghe River by the east foot of the Liupan Mountain in southern Ningxia. The river is a tributary of the Weihe River, which, itself, is a tributary of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Based on the project, the county government of Pengyang invested further to integrate updated internet technology specially to improve the quality and stability of water supply in rural areas.</p>
<p>Zhang admitted that facilities didn’t work well at first and water quality was not satisfying.<br>The county later transformed the facilities in the reservoir, the pump station and the pipe network, and equipped every household with smart water meters, which enables real-time video monitoring of the whole water supply process, as well as remote control and management on computer and phone.</p>
<p>The water management staff can monitor the PH value and turbidity of the water online. Once there’s a breakdown, the system would automatically sound the alarm and distribute maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>According to Niu, if there were a communication failure at the pump station, the system inside the station would be able to supply water steadily for at least a week.</p>
<p>The intelligent facilities have solved the problem of high cost and management difficulty caused by rural households being numerous but scattered, Jiang says.</p>
<p>Therefore, water fees are lowered in these underdeveloped villages where pipelines have to go through mountains and ditches.</p>
<p>As Ningxia has already built a unified online platform before to manage water conservancy information, and facilities to provide internet access for rural areas, the county doesn’t have to invest much on internet infrastructure for the transformation such as server and the machine room, nor the data operation and security issues, according to Niu.<br>Over the past decade, Ningxia has been prioritizing the resolution to provide rural areas with safe drinking water. Tap water penetration has risen from 26 percent at the end of 2006 to 90 percent by 2019.</p>
<p>“We have historically solved the problem of water shortage and covered the barren hills with green,” says Ma Hancheng, vice-chairman of the autonomous region and a deputy to the National People’s Congress at a recent interview with chinanews.com.<br>Ningxia is now seeking to promote the intelligent water supply facilities of Pengyang to the whole region and is determined to provide replicable and referential experience for the country, where freshwater resource is much limited and distributes unevenly.<br>The region is calling for more financial and policy support from the country, according to a recent proposal from the region’s water conservancy department.<br>Commentary<br>Problem of water scarcity<br>Residents of some areas of China are yearning for rainfall, people don’t have water to support their basic lives, linking to the concept scarcity which means the state of being scarce or in short supply or shortage, they can’t get affordable clean water. I need to explore the causes of the issue and before I discuss whether automation and smart technology is an effective and sustainable way to solve the problem of water scarcity.</p>
<p>In one of China’s driest areas is lack of water and it also means the this area face a<br>shortage which means situation in which something needed cannot to b obtained in sufficient amounts. In this area, it extremely lacks underground water and rain. It took people living in the central and south of Ningxia Hui autonomous region nearly 40 years to complete this arduous journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/18/Ugl3b8.png" alt="Ugl3b8.png"></p>
<p>From Fig1, we can see that because of the population increases, the demand for water also expands as water is a kind of necessities，so demand curve shifts to the right. However, this place is rain less, so the supply of water decreases, so the supply curve shifts to the left, this will cause a gap between the Qd and Qs, this means the shortage of water and there is a tendency of price rising.</p>
<p>There exists the necessity for government to intervene and why we use this method, how to use this method and the disadvantages of this method. This problem of scarcity of water need to be solved because water is a kind of necessities, and people use tap water not only to drink and shower, but also to clean the house, water the flowers, feed livestock, and importantly, flush the toilet. If people’s necessities cannot be satisfied, they may have low level of living standard. In this way, this will increase the poverty of this area and the country which means the state of being extremely poor. So if we use automation and smart technology to solve the problem of water scarcity, people in poor areas can use water in their daily life and they can also use water to grow crops in order to support their living expenses, so their economic well-being will increase which is defined as having present and future financial security.</p>
<p>From the graph, we can see the change of the demand and supply curve. The demand curve doesn’t change because water is a kind of necessities, and people’s demand is stable. The supply curve shifts to the right because the automation and smart technology helps transports water to the area.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/18/UglWx1.png" alt="UglWx1.png"></p>
<p>Then, I want to discuss how to use this method. In order to solve the problem of scarcity, the meaning of using this system is to transport the water from places in the south where water is very sufficient to the places where water is really scarce. However, the facilities to solve the water problem is really expensive and difficult to build. From the news, we can get that that area used 40 years to operate the system properly. So, we can get that it took so long time to operate the systems. In addition, the cost of using this system is very high. This is due to that the water fees in poor areas are lower than other areas because government in order to reduce the poverty. However, the facilities to solve the water problem is really expensive and difficult to build.</p>
<p>However, the method which uses automation and smart technology to solve the water problem has many disadvantages. Ignoring the disadvantages which are mentioned in the fourth paragraph, we will talk about the results the after using this method. The most significant one is that the quality of water can’t be guaranteed, and the stability of water is not very high. As a result, people may face the problem that the quality of water is very low, and this will lead people to have health problems and low stability will cause the living conditions of people to be influenced.</p>
<p> As a result, I need to discuss how to solve the issue of this method. If government wants to popularize the technology<br> and use it in different areas in the country, it needs a long time and huge amount of money. If government wants to<br> improve the quality and stability of water, this will use more time and money. In order to solve this problem, the only<br> way is to solve this problem is to give more money. As a result, this is link to the government revenue, definitely<br> government will give money. However, government may have to move money from other areas to solve water<br> scarcity，this will have an opportunity cost and government may have to increase the tax in order to increase the<br> government revenue. As a result, this is related to the government policies，government need to change policies to<br> achieve the aim.</p>
<p>In long run, using automation and smart technology to solve this problem isn’t a sustainable solution. Although we can solve some certain areas’ issues of water scarcity, we need to use very arduous ways. In fact, government can’t have so much money in a short time ，how much more the method use so much money has so many drawbacks. In conclusion, government needs to find more effective ways.</p>

<p>title: A volunteer experience<br>date: 2020-06-23 09:32:31<br>tags: A volunteer experience</p>
<p>I would like to describe an experience which I went to the Ming Tomb Museum to have the volunteer test. This was the first time I had a volunteer test.</p>
<p>I want to record this experience because this experience was really special for me. Before entering the senior school, I have never had a so professional test for volunteer and this was the first time, I knew that to be a volunteer have so many requirements.  The teachers in the museum told us to recite explanatory words and talked these contents to the visitors.</p>
<p>This was really a big challenge for me, this was the first time I try to recite the words. At the that moment, I just entered the senior high school and I haven’t adapted the pace of life in the school and I was very busy at that time, I have to cope with the study and also different kinds of activities .As a result, I hardly find any time to recite  the articles as I was so tired very day. In addition, I didn’t know the stories and history very clearly, it was very difficult for me to remember them in a very short time.</p>
<p>I tried it very hard to recite it, but I couldn’t find so much time to do so. I recited for so long time until late in the night before I had to go to there have the test. I was afraid that I couldn’t pass the test. However, I still have one hope that the test may be not so strict, but I thought wrong, the teacher was so harsh, she let me to repeat the articles for several times and she seemed that wasn’t satisfied with me. I felt that I couldn’t pass it successfully and I was so nervous. However, the teacher  then said to me surprised me a lot .She said that this test was to be responsible for the visitors and we have to make sure that the stories we told to visitors were correct and we also have to make sure that the visitors’ experience was good,  in this way ,volunteers should have the etiquettes and the professional knowledge to make sure the visitors to have the good impression, she said that she have saw my efforts and she also said that I have to practice it for more times. I was so surprised that I have the test and I also understand and remember some ideas that I have known for the first time.</p>
<p>Through this test, I recites these articles not only for myself, I thought these knowledge was no importance for me , but I have known that this was for the visitors , to be a volunteer , not only to gain an award for myself but also to gain the happiness through bringing others good experience and knowledge. The main idea to be a volunteer is to experience the sharedness to others, the reward is not important at all. So, I will treat the volunteer work more seriously, I have practiced the articles for several times, I want to record memories of my volunteer work and the happiness I told others useful and interesting stories.</p>

<p>title: EV商学院路演小结<br>date: 2020-06-18 22:56:12<br>tags: Ev 商学院路演小结<br>前段时间去看了EV商学院的路演，看到学长学姐的项目的汇报，有良多感触，有收益也有思考。</p>
<p>首先，这场路演分为A，B两组主要是关于飞跃公司设计一个线下快闪店。为十分的惊异于学长学姐的设计以及思考。首先第一组，最让我有感触的是第一组的设计，为认为设计非常的精妙，设计引导消费者不管怎样都直接走到店内，店内全自动的销售和制作方式之分新颖，店内虽然不大却使用非常的精妙的原理来增大空间，店外部使用十分精妙的灯光设计，来吸引消费者，圆形的设计非常的有设计感，来增加的消费者的消费量。其中赛博朋克的设计非常的的吸引我，使用了全球时尚界十分有名的设计来设计可以给消费者带来新鲜感和购买冲动得雨屋，以及产品中融合了中国水墨的元素十分的有特色，水转印的技术也十分的吸引人，简单易行而且设计出独一无二的产品是吸引年轻消费者的一大特色。第二组的红外线设计和数据分析十分精妙，通过红外线的装置来观测人群是十分前沿的想法。然后，他们想要采用时下潮流的电商和游戏动漫联名来吸引消费者也是十分有趣的想法。</p>
<p>通过了路演，为非常钦佩学长学姐的能力和想法，这两组各显神通各有千秋，但是我也发现了两组有一个共同性的问题，就是经费和方便问题，其中第一组的设计固然精妙，但是自动化的装置的价格确实不菲，而且作为一个快闪店，流动性也要考虑到其中，不知道复杂的设计会不会有问题产生。而第二组去的想法首先红外线装置是十分神奇的，而我们可以看到的是电商固然是一个十分有效的方法，但是呢，电商和联名的方法，别的企业也能想到也可以做同样的尝试，而且对于电商的的邀请是十分严格的，也许有名的电商才能带来足够多的收益，但是很显然，这样的电商的价格是十分昂贵的，所以又回到了资金的问题，我认为这一点是十分重要的，实用性也要考虑到设计中去。</p>
<p>经过了此次路演，让我钦佩学长学姐们，他们的设计真的是非常的有创意而且很丰富,但是也并非十分完美，让我的感触是，所有的设计都是需要不断改进的，都是要考虑全面的，没有完美的设计，只有不断的进步。</p>
