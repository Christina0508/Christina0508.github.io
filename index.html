<p>title: Subway lines prices system<br>date: 2021-02-21 10:53:35<br>tags: Excel and python<br>—When I was young i always wondered how can a subway station got to know the subway prices. This is depend on how many stations you have taken. However , it is really amazing is that you may have change your number of subway and these lines may have same stations. In this way , the number of stations is confused.<br>—I have now figured out that the subway stations may based on the shortest distance you have travelled. This can be explained by simople Excel, as below:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yoZDcd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/21/yoZDcd.md.png" alt="yoZDcd.md.png"></a><br>Then, in this way, we can use this Excel by coding and get a convienient subway prices system simply.<br>Then, it’s the coding part:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yoeV8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/21/yoeV8e.md.png" alt="yoeV8e.md.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yoe8PS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/21/yoe8PS.md.png" alt="yoe8PS.md.png"></a></p>

        <p>In the cycle pf movie stars, most of them have a very complex social network. This is due to the reason that<br>they all have to collaborate with a lot of people. It is really difficult to give out their connection of their social networks. It may be easy to use Python and NetworkX to analyse the connection and the difference.</p>
<p>Then,it is the code part:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylFoJ1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylFoJ1.md.png" alt="ylFoJ1.md.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylk6kd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylk6kd.md.png" alt="ylk6kd.md.png"></a><br>Then, in this case , we can use the coding to see the gragh of the networks of the stars. Then, from the coding above , we can get a graph of the “Advengers”.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylAKNd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylAKNd.md.png" alt="ylAKNd.md.png"></a><br>If we use a less dense movie, we can get a more clear gragh of the social networks of stars.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylAd4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylAd4s.md.jpg" alt="ylAd4s.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In conclusion, Python and NetworkX is a very useful way to analyse the datas.And it not only can give the relationship of stars in one film, but also the relationship of a series.This is very convienent and useful.</p>

<p>title: Summary about python activity<br>date: 2020-09-26 23:05:02<br>tags: the emotional states of blogger<br>作为一个编程小白，我在大概三个月前才开始学习python。起初的初衷是因为python如此的火爆，已经成为现如今流行的存在。由于未来专业方向的缘故，python的学习能为我未来的学习省下许多的力气。首先，Python是一门解释性语言，这是他的特点，这让Python似乎与“高效”无缘。然而你知道吗，著名的Instagram服务器就是是用Python+Django搭建的，而且月活用户超过7亿。要知道Python+Django是一个以速度慢著称的web框架，一定是python的某个优点深深的吸引了他们。是的，这个优点就是，开发效率高。</p>
<p>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.<br>   –摘自Python官网<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.python.org</a></p>
<p>由于在此之前，可以说我几乎从未接触过编程，所以在进行时，可是说是比较艰难，而且由于在平时的学习中几乎用不到编程，所以我练习的机会非常的少，所以对于知识点的运用非常的缺乏。经过了几乎一个暑假的荒废，我已经忘了很多的知识，所以抱着来唤醒回忆的目的来参加这个活动。</p>
<p>这个活动的流程主要是使用python的语言来分析博主的情感状态，这是用数据分析的方法来获得准确的情感状态。首先拿到这个题目的时候是我非常是一头雾水的，毫无头绪，因为我并不知道这是让我们干什么。还好有老师给我们分析这个题目，这个题目主要就是把单词和符号分离，然后把所有的句子分析归类，来找到表达情感状态的单词，从而来表达人物的情感状态。</p>
<p>在一开始，我只能先看老师的演示程序来试图理解这个分析的流程。通过程序的报错来发现问题，渐渐的，我开始慢慢回忆一些学过的知识点，所以我翻看书来回忆学过却遗忘的知识点，根据书上的例子来运用到我们的题目中去，我发现可以有效的回忆和使用以前遗忘的知识点来编写程序了。但是由于重新拾起的缘故，所以我在进行得过程中出现了很多无法自己解决的报错问题，在学长的细心指导下，我才能一直畅通的进行下去。</p>
<p>通过这次的活动，让我重新温习了一些已经遗忘了的知识。python是一门需要练习的学问，想要能够完美的学习会python，光靠老师的讲解和书上例题的演示是远远不够的，只有不断的练习巩固和操练才能真正的掌握。由于平时的学业，能够使用到python 的时机也是非常的少的，这样的活动不仅让我能巩固我的编程知识，还让我来认识和了解到大学的python作业是什么样的，对于我未来的申请肯定是有很大帮助的。我希望我能够多参加这样的活动，让我的python知识不是只存在于书本而是真正的对我起到发展性的作用。</p>

        <p>As I have went into the AS，this is the time of me to be the leader of one club. The words I want to say is the club I set this year-the eight-valley club.</p>
<p>I want to record the activity we took last week, and this was the first time I had one club activity as the leader. This club was set to do the commercial program and the central idea of our club is new retail.</p>
<p>During the first activity, we have the about three parts. The first part is to introduce our club culture and the logo of our club. The second part is to let students to introduce themselves and know about each other together. The third part is to introduce them the idea of the new retail and this can help them know about our club better and give a better performance in the later club activities. Then, we gave students the tasks they need to do due to the next club activity.</p>
<p>Because I haven’t had any experience before, and I found that I have some problems in this activity. First of all, the problem of the facilities. Our principal required us to put our electronic equipment in his office. Because this was the first time, I didn’t know that I have to take it at the nine period. I thought that he will go home at the same time after school. As a result, my laptop was locked in his office. Then, during the time when students introduce themselves, they felt very shy, so this part wasn’t so successful. In addition, during the time of the we introduce our club because we waste some time to find the facilities. As a result, we have to rush the introduction, so I think our club members didn’t know our club very clearly.</p>
<p>Form the first activity, I decided to do some measures to improve the quality of our activity. To take the facility in time is really important. Then, to introduce our club again during the second activity in order to let our members to know the club better. Then, setting more interesting games to let them know each other well.  </p>

<p>title:  Summary about my drawing courses<br>date: 2020-08-22 19:47:43<br>tags: Drawing during summer holiday<br>I have kept drawing since I was only a little girl. I always kept drawing as one hobby for myself and I always sticked to this hobby until I entered the ninth grade.</p>
<p>When I entered the eighth grade, I was very busy with my study and I not only had to have many courses in the school, but also need to take extra courses during the free time. As a result, I didn’t keep my frequency to go drawing courses once a week and I only went to there through the frequency of about two weeks once or even three weeks once. In this way, obviously, I didn’t get much practice and I became even lazier after that year. Since I entered the ninth grade and I became much busier of my study and I even couldn’t find any time to go drawing. Then, a second time I found one excuse for myself. I told myself that I would go and attend the courses if I could find any time free. However, the fact is that i found more time to finish my homework, my efficiency is lower than before I was. As a result, I couldn’t find any time free to attend the courses.</p>
<p>During this summer holiday, I haven’t taken any courses in the last one year and I found the students around me all have their hobbies. Then, I realized that I should have my own hobby as well. I decided to pick up my hobby and took the drawing courses and always sticked to it. So, I tried to finish my work and found some time to take the courses. However, when I took the course for the first time and then I felt that it was really struggling for me to draw as before, as I have forgotten about the skills I learnt before and it couldn’t find any fulfillment from the course again. I had an idea to give up it and I didn’t to waste my time anymore. However, my teacher told me that if i tried to practice for some lessons, I would find that It didn’t forget about anything, I just haven’t practiced it for a long time. As I have learned it for so many years before, I have a very good basic training and it will be very simple for me to pick up it very soon.</p>
<p>Then, a really amazing thing happened during the second lesson. When I just drawn myself during that lesson. This maybe something that seems to be unbelievable, but it was true that I suddenly learned that how to draw ,which meant I suddenly understand the method to draw and I even just know how to draw before, but I never understood that why I draw in that way. I thought that maybe this was because I have grown up even older and it has become very easy for me to draw. Just after several lessons, I found that the senescent when I drew before.</p>
<p>During this experience, I decided that I would stick to my hobby in the future even if I will be really busy with my study, I thought that maybe I could understand the meaning quicker if I didn’t give up it for one year. I think it’s a truth for all the matters, insistence is always important for everyone, I will remember it no matter I will do anything in the future.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddVDuq.jpg" alt="ddVDuq.jpg"><br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddZ9Vf.jpg" alt="ddZ9Vf.jpg"></p>

<p>title: My first IELTS speaking test<br>date: 2020-08-17 15:24:28<br>tags: the feeling of the first speaking test</p>
<p>I’d like to describe my first IELTS speaking test. I have prepared for my IELTS test for a long time. </p>
<p>Although I have taking several mock tests, I haven’t tried a real one before. In addition, there’s a huge difference between the mock exam and the real exam. First, it’s really official and I didn’t know the process of the test before. Second,    I have never had one speaking mock test before with one foreign teacher, so it’s easy for me to feel very nervous. Plus, this time I have to take this exam in the morning, so there’s less time for me to do psychological construction.</p>
<p>When I got the test center, the process of the exam was so complex, and I was frightened by that. I felt really nervous since I just got into the university where I took the test. I felt that a deer was running in my heart and I felt really bad. In order to let me calm down, I thought I have to do some measures. First, when I got in, I told myself that I can do it, there is no need for me to be afraid of this test, the foreign teachers just the same as Chinese teachers and they are all friendly. I just to have one talk with him not a test at all. I could calm down for some while. However, when I got into the building, all the students were followed the guidance of the teacher to sit outdoor of the classroom where you would take the test. All the students were waiting there until the examiner called them. I waited there for some while and all the students have been in the classroom. This is only me who still sited on the corridor and then the sense of fear came to me again. This time the way to talk to myself was not available. Then, I overcome one new idea immediately. I let myself to take several deep breaths and just look at the floor not the door. In this way, it really helps me slow down my heartbeat. </p>
<p>As a result, although I couldn’t let myself be calm as I am during the normal days, I could let myself not to be too nervous which would influence my condition during the speaking test. I still felt a little bit nervous during the test, but this didn’t matter too much. I could give out my opinion and talk to the examiner quite fluently. I think that maybe a little bit tension can help me do better in the test.</p>
<p>I think that although I haven’t known the score I got, I think this test is still meaningful for me. This is the first time I have one speaking test, I’ve developed some tips to help me overcome the psychological problems. I think that the most important isn’t that I got the ways to help myself, but to get the idea that I can overcome all the problems if I try my best. This time if I didn’t help myself, I couldn’t say a word to the examiner just because I’m afraid. If I meet some difficulties in the life, I have to try to overcome and solve it, not to try to escape it. Always try is the best solution.</p>
