        <p>In the cycle pf movie stars, most of them have a very complex social network. This is due to the reason that<br>they all have to collaborate with a lot of people. It is really difficult to give out their connection of their social networks. It may be easy to use Python and NetworkX to analyse the connection and the difference.</p>
<p>Then,it is the code part:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylFoJ1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylFoJ1.md.png" alt="ylFoJ1.md.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylk6kd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylk6kd.md.png" alt="ylk6kd.md.png"></a><br>Then, in this case , we can use the coding to see the gragh of the networks of the stars. Then, from the coding above , we can get a graph of the “Advengers”.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylAKNd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylAKNd.md.png" alt="ylAKNd.md.png"></a><br>If we use a less dense movie, we can get a more clear gragh of the social networks of stars.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylAd4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylAd4s.md.jpg" alt="ylAd4s.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In conclusion, Python and NetworkX is a very useful way to analyse the datas.And it not only can give the relationship of stars in one film, but also the relationship of a series.This is very convienent and useful.</p>

        <p>I love football very much and my favorite football player is Lionel Messi.<br>People all think Messi is a football genius, he is a man who is blessed by God. But after he showed a talent for football as a child, doctors told him he had dwarfism and that his family would not be able to pay for his medical bills. No player is known to suffer from this kind of disease, and it seemed to tell Messi who is only 12, that his football career was over. Undaunted, he pursued his football dream until the world-famous Barcelona club spotted him and offered to pay his medical bills. I admired him for his courage to insist his dream and I thought his success not only because of his talent, but also because his hard work. When I felt afraid and wanted to give up something, I told myself to insist because the challenge I faced was smaller than Messi’s.<br>If I can meet him, the question I wanted to ask him about his plan, because he will attend the fifth world cup this year and I also want to know his future destination whether he will come back to Barcelona. Messi is a very gentle person, but at the same time very fragile, I hope he can become confident and strengthen his leadership, as the captain, he is important for the development of Argentina team.</p>

        <p>Confidence has always been an essential part for me. It came from my early experience in learning swimming. At the beginning, I could not stay in water without a ring and was afraid of drawning in water. The teacher taught me to overcome the fear step by step and always reminded me to believe in myself. The great sense of accomplishment from the experience managed to motivate me with a confident attitude.<br>In school’s one important exam, I felt very nervous and found it really difficult, which led to a far worse exam result than usual. Exposed in the mood of despair, I asked myself to cheer up. I knew that everyone would not question my ability and knowledge from this single failure, as I was always capable to overcome these challenges like how I learned to swim. I soon recovered from the negative emotion and began to review the reasons for the terrible exam; this failure became an important learning opportunity as it helped me to navigate the overlooked issues in my reviews. I am more confident to combat further challenges afterwards.<br>Extending from my own experience, I have always been trying to preach my confident attitudes to the others. I tell my friends that I trust them and they should trust themselves whenever they face failures like I did. In group assignments specifically, my attitude allowed the group to critically reflect on any issue together to find a solution, believing that we can overcome whatever difficult.  </p>

        <p>I served as the president of the business club of the school. In the practice of business club, I suggested adding popularity detection hardware to the Christmas market and set up electronic price tags to analyze the popularity of goods. Data can make people’s purchase intentions becomes more visual and quantitative. It further deepened my interest in computer science and led me to realize the application value of statistics and modelling. My student work not only trained my leadership skills, but also my organization skills. In the process of leading my club to win the honor of the best club, I not only realized the importance of discipline, but also exercised my working ability, such as reporting ability, which helped me to report my research logically, words could give data a deeper understanding. Making me summaries and concludes my work more quickly. </p>

        <p>During the pandemic, museums and libraries were closed, so they did not need volunteers to do off-line services, making it hard for me to connect with my volunteer community.<br>In order to spread the museum cultures, I suggested to call volunteers to write articles for the museum’s Wechat official account as alternative offline participation. I wrote one poem to relate the museum and plum blossom mountain. In addition, we recorded videos at home to encourage people to spread out positive energy on behalf of the volunteer program. I also read books and made podcasts on the library’s social media to preach some overlooked facts and knowledge.<br>I noticed that, despite the working forms of volunteers have changed a lot, the pandemic haven’t interrupted people’s enthusiasm to continue being helpful. With this key mindset, nothing challenging, including the Pandemic, could not stop idea and thought spreads. I was honored to be together with the group of volunteers to truly devote my contribution in helping out the museum’s promotions and preaching new knowledge to various groups of people. The pandemic seemed to have forced us to be apart, but our practices binded the community with deeper connections. </p>

[Photo/Sipa]<br>China’s fiscal revenue, which reported its first growth this year in June, returned to expansionary territory, enabling stronger fiscal support for the economy over the second half, experts said on Friday.<br>The government’s general budgeted revenue grew by 3.2 percent year-on-year last month, marking the first expansion this year, thanks to the recovery in business activity and imports, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.<br>Fiscal revenue has been in a rally since the second quarter of the year as the economy staged comeback growth from the shutdowns brought by the COVID-19 outbreak, said Liu Jinyun, an official with the ministry.<br>Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter, according to Liu.<br>The year-on-year slide in the value-added tax revenue, the biggest contributor to the country’s national coffer, narrowed by 19.1 percent for the January-June period, versus 23.6 percent for the first three months as production activities in the industrial sector continued to recover, Liu said.<br>“The positive growth in fiscal revenue is a reflection of the nation’s steady economic recovery as well as the stable operation of market entities,” said Yang Weiyong, an associate professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.<br>With the economy continuing to recover in the second half, fiscal revenue is expected to further rise and increase funds available for the government to support the economy, Yang said.<br>The country reported a 1.6 percent year-on-year contraction in GDP for the first half of the year on Thursday, recovering from the 6.8 percent plunge for the first quarter, while analysts expect China’s economic growth to come in at about 2 to 3 percent for the whole year.<br>Luo Zhiheng, former chief macroeconomic researcher at the Evergrande Research Institute, said the proactive fiscal policy has played a key role in facilitating the economic recovery, with targeted tax and fee cuts and relatively strong fiscal expenditure focused on combating the contagion, ensuring people’s livelihood and funding major construction projects.<br>The country’s fiscal spending in the first six months fell by 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 11.64 trillion yuan, slower than the drop in revenue, according to the ministry.Looking into the second half, Luo said the country is expected to accelerate fiscal spending and shore up domestic demand, with the recovery in fiscal revenue and money raised by government<br>bonds providing more funds.<br>China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month, the ministry said.<br>The country has also stepped up the issuance of the projected 3.75 trillion yuan worth of special local government bonds, which are mainly to fund infrastructure investment. A total of 2.24 trillion yuan worth of the bonds were issued as of Tuesday, with 85 percent of the money raised already be spent, the ministry said.<br>“The Chinese economy still faces the risk that the global spread of COVID-19 may hit external demand, threatening employment and the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises.<br>Extending supports to these areas will be the focus of fiscal policy in the coming months,” Luo said.<br>Nonetheless, analysts said it is unlikely that China will elevate the quota of special treasuries, given the need to prevent excessive stimulus from causing risk.<br>“To prevent the distortion in resource allocation, it is more advisable for China to further the tax and fee cut measures than issue more bonds to fund government-led investment,” Yang said.<br>                                            Commentary<br>                     How reducing tax revenue to help recover<br>Because of the rise of the novel coronavirus in the world, the recovery is the most important aim of China, in order to recover, linking to the concept tax which means that a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.I want to discuss whether it’s helpful for recovery and why it offers a helping hand to recover.<br>From the news, we can get that “Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter.”In this way, we can know that the fiscal revenue of the first quarter of 2020 is more than that of the revenue of the second quarter. This may because the indirect tax and direct tax all decreases. Firstly, government gives back some tax to people that are directly charged from their salaries. Secondly, government may also reduce the prices of products especially the prices of<br>necessities. In this way, people will be more affordable for these products. As a result, people can balance their lives during the novel coronavirus.<br>—<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a81iWD.png" alt="a81iWD.png"><br>From Fig1，government imposes a tax on the supply . The supply curve shifts to the left. In addition, many people cannot work during the virus period and some people even lose their jobs, so the demand for people to buy things will decrease because they may prefer to save their money as they have no confidence for the future. The demand curve will also shift to the left. When quantity is certain, the tax revenue is the quantity multiply the price difference, so the tax revenue before the coronavirus is tax revenue 1 which is the dark bule block, and the tax revenue during the virus is the tax revenue 2 which is the light blue block.<br>In July, the fiscal revenue of China showed the first time to recover, this was because the recovery of imports and the recovery of business activity. From the news, we can get that “China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month.” In order to support the further recovery, the government has issued 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries to help state-owned business. Issuing money cannot help recovering very well. Government help these companies, so these companies can continue to produce instead of going bankrupt. This also decreases the costs of the products. As a result, the prices of products will decrease, people will be more affordable for them. The economic growth can grow. However, issuing money cannot help recovering very well, because of the virus, although people can be more affordable for products, they may have no confidence for the future, and they will save the money instead of spending money. As a result, money of government has wasted and has no effects. In this way, there is little help for recovery. In addition, issuing the money may lead the distortion in resource allocation because it’s difficult for the government to estimate how much money to give which sector, so it’s difficult to spend money effectively.<br>From the news, the writer points out that reducing tax revenue is a better way to help recover than issuing the money to help business activities. If government reduces the tax revenue, not only the prices of the products reduce, but also people’s salaries increase (both direct tax and indirect tax). In this way, people will have money to afford products. Although we may face the same problem, that’s people with no confidence about future, government may face a different situation. Imposing tax is a method which is used in the long run. People can’t get much money from tax immediately. As a result, they may choose to save money recently, but they will spend money in long run.<br>In the Fig2, if government reduces the tax revenue, people will have the incentives to buy things. In this way, people’s demand will increase, so the demand curve shifts to the right.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/a813lQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a813lQ.png" alt="a813lQ.png"></a><br>In conclusion, issuing the money is easy to get to lead the distortion in resource allocation, so reduce tax revenue may be is a more reasonable method to help recovery. However, is very difficult for people to get much money through reducing the tax, so in long run this method may be is a good way to help recovery.</p>

        <p>In order to better organize and read statistics, I began to learn coding. I combined my practices with the hobby in watching football games, as I trained my modeling ability by letting my programs predict the results of football matches.<br>To provide myself with a fundamental start, I carefully read about the visualization of images and the modelling method of decision trees on the website Scikit-Learn. Decision trees for me are great graphical methods of calculating the probability of each branch of the tree on the basis of knowing the probability of each situation; more importantly, its logics were the most straightforward for coding starters like me. I learned to convert the data of a group of teams’ previous games into the form of export_graphviz decision tree. Then, I used a large number of data form the statistics to train the decision tree and the remaining part to test the quality of it. In essence, it is a problem of probability calculation, but the visualization of the computer makes the originally ethereal probability become intuitive. This deepens my interest in continuing to learn coding, which can help me to use mathematics conveniently and express mathematics in a simple language. science and led me to realize the application value of statistics and modelling. </p>
