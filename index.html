        <p>In the cycle pf movie stars, most of them have a very complex social network. This is due to the reason that<br>they all have to collaborate with a lot of people. It is really difficult to give out their connection of their social networks. It may be easy to use Python and NetworkX to analyse the connection and the difference.</p>
<p>Then,it is the code part:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylFoJ1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylFoJ1.md.png" alt="ylFoJ1.md.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylk6kd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylk6kd.md.png" alt="ylk6kd.md.png"></a><br>Then, in this case , we can use the coding to see the gragh of the networks of the stars. Then, from the coding above , we can get a graph of the “Advengers”.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylAKNd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylAKNd.md.png" alt="ylAKNd.md.png"></a><br>If we use a less dense movie, we can get a more clear gragh of the social networks of stars.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/ylAd4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/03/ylAd4s.md.jpg" alt="ylAd4s.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In conclusion, Python and NetworkX is a very useful way to analyse the datas.And it not only can give the relationship of stars in one film, but also the relationship of a series.This is very convienent and useful.</p>

Tax    revenue    shows    signs    of    recovery</code></pre><p>By ZHOU LANXU | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2020-07-18 07:58<br>A bank teller counts RMB banknotes at a bank branch in Hai’an of East China’s Jiangsu province, on June 24, 2020. [Photo/Sipa]<br>China’s fiscal revenue, which reported its first growth this year in June, returned to expansionary territory, enabling stronger fiscal support for the economy over the second half, experts said on Friday.<br>The government’s general budgeted revenue grew by 3.2 percent year-on-year last month, marking the first expansion this year, thanks to the recovery in business activity and imports, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.<br>Fiscal revenue has been in a rally since the second quarter of the year as the economy staged comeback growth from the shutdowns brought by the COVID-19 outbreak, said Liu Jinyun, an official with the ministry.<br>Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter, according to Liu.<br>The year-on-year slide in the value-added tax revenue, the biggest contributor to the country’s national coffer, narrowed by 19.1 percent for the January-June period, versus 23.6 percent for the first three months as production activities in the industrial sector continued to recover, Liu said.<br>“The positive growth in fiscal revenue is a reflection of the nation’s steady economic recovery as well as the stable operation of market entities,” said Yang Weiyong, an associate professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.<br>With the economy continuing to recover in the second half, fiscal revenue is expected to further rise and increase funds available for the government to support the economy, Yang said.<br>The country reported a 1.6 percent year-on-year contraction in GDP for the first half of the year on Thursday, recovering from the 6.8 percent plunge for the first quarter, while analysts expect China’s economic growth to come in at about 2 to 3 percent for the whole year.<br>Luo Zhiheng, former chief macroeconomic researcher at the Evergrande Research Institute, said the proactive fiscal policy has played a key role in facilitating the economic recovery, with targeted tax and fee cuts and relatively strong fiscal expenditure focused on combating the contagion, ensuring people’s livelihood and funding major construction projects.<br>The country’s fiscal spending in the first six months fell by 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 11.64 trillion yuan, slower than the drop in revenue, according to the ministry.Looking into the second half, Luo said the country is expected to accelerate fiscal spending and shore up domestic demand, with the recovery in fiscal revenue and money raised by government<br>bonds providing more funds.<br>China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month, the ministry said.<br>The country has also stepped up the issuance of the projected 3.75 trillion yuan worth of special local government bonds, which are mainly to fund infrastructure investment. A total of 2.24 trillion yuan worth of the bonds were issued as of Tuesday, with 85 percent of the money raised already be spent, the ministry said.<br>“The Chinese economy still faces the risk that the global spread of COVID-19 may hit external demand, threatening employment and the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises.<br>Extending supports to these areas will be the focus of fiscal policy in the coming months,” Luo said.<br>Nonetheless, analysts said it is unlikely that China will elevate the quota of special treasuries, given the need to prevent excessive stimulus from causing risk.<br>“To prevent the distortion in resource allocation, it is more advisable for China to further the tax and fee cut measures than issue more bonds to fund government-led investment,” Yang said.<br>                                            Commentary<br>                     How reducing tax revenue to help recover<br>Because of the rise of the novel coronavirus in the world, the recovery is the most important aim of China, in order to recover, linking to the concept tax which means that a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.I want to discuss whether it’s helpful for recovery and why it offers a helping hand to recover.<br>From the news, we can get that “Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter.”In this way, we can know that the fiscal revenue of the first quarter of 2020 is more than that of the revenue of the second quarter. This may because the indirect tax and direct tax all decreases. Firstly, government gives back some tax to people that are directly charged from their salaries. Secondly, government may also reduce the prices of products especially the prices of<br>necessities. In this way, people will be more affordable for these products. As a result, people can balance their lives during the novel coronavirus.<br>—<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a81iWD.png" alt="a81iWD.png"><br>From Fig1，government imposes a tax on the supply . The supply curve shifts to the left. In addition, many people cannot work during the virus period and some people even lose their jobs, so the demand for people to buy things will decrease because they may prefer to save their money as they have no confidence for the future. The demand curve will also shift to the left. When quantity is certain, the tax revenue is the quantity multiply the price difference, so the tax revenue before the coronavirus is tax revenue 1 which is the dark bule block, and the tax revenue during the virus is the tax revenue 2 which is the light blue block.<br>In July, the fiscal revenue of China showed the first time to recover, this was because the recovery of imports and the recovery of business activity. From the news, we can get that “China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month.” In order to support the further recovery, the government has issued 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries to help state-owned business. Issuing money cannot help recovering very well. Government help these companies, so these companies can continue to produce instead of going bankrupt. This also decreases the costs of the products. As a result, the prices of products will decrease, people will be more affordable for them. The economic growth can grow. However, issuing money cannot help recovering very well, because of the virus, although people can be more affordable for products, they may have no confidence for the future, and they will save the money instead of spending money. As a result, money of government has wasted and has no effects. In this way, there is little help for recovery. In addition, issuing the money may lead the distortion in resource allocation because it’s difficult for the government to estimate how much money to give which sector, so it’s difficult to spend money effectively.<br>From the news, the writer points out that reducing tax revenue is a better way to help recover than issuing the money to help business activities. If government reduces the tax revenue, not only the prices of the products reduce, but also people’s salaries increase (both direct tax and indirect tax). In this way, people will have money to afford products. Although we may face the same problem, that’s people with no confidence about future, government may face a different situation. Imposing tax is a method which is used in the long run. People can’t get much money from tax immediately. As a result, they may choose to save money recently, but they will spend money in long run.<br>In the Fig2, if government reduces the tax revenue, people will have the incentives to buy things. In this way, people’s demand will increase, so the demand curve shifts to the right.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/a813lQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a813lQ.png" alt="a813lQ.png"></a><br>In conclusion, issuing the money is easy to get to lead the distortion in resource allocation, so reduce tax revenue may be is a more reasonable method to help recovery. However, is very difficult for people to get much money through reducing the tax, so in long run this method may be is a good way to help recovery.</p>

<p> layout: Subway lines prices system<br>title:  Excel and Python<br>date: 2022-05-28 10:53:35<br>tags: Python</p>
<hr>
<p>When I was young i always wondered how can a subway station got to know the subway prices. This is depend on how many stations you have taken. However , it is really amazing is that you may have change your number of subway and these lines may have same stations. In this way , the number of stations is confused. </p>
<hr>
<p>I have now figured out that the subway stations may based on the shortest distance you have travelled. This can be explained by simople Excel, as below:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yoZDcd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/21/yoZDcd.md.png" alt="yoZDcd.md.png"></a><br>Then, in this way, we can use this Excel by coding and get a convienient subway prices system simply.<br>Then, it’s the coding part:<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yoeV8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/21/yoeV8e.md.png" alt="yoeV8e.md.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yoe8PS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/21/yoe8PS.md.png" alt="yoe8PS.md.png"></a></p>

        <p>作为一个编程小白，我在大概三个月前才开始学习python。起初的初衷是因为python如此的火爆，已经成为现如今流行的存在。由于未来专业方向的缘故，python的学习能为我未来的学习省下许多的力气。首先，Python是一门解释性语言，这是他的特点，这让Python似乎与“高效”无缘。然而你知道吗，著名的Instagram服务器就是是用Python+Django搭建的，而且月活用户超过7亿。要知道Python+Django是一个以速度慢著称的web框架，一定是python的某个优点深深的吸引了他们。是的，这个优点就是，开发效率高。</p>
<p>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.<br>   –摘自Python官网<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.python.org</a></p>
<p>由于在此之前，可以说我几乎从未接触过编程，所以在进行时，可是说是比较艰难，而且由于在平时的学习中几乎用不到编程，所以我练习的机会非常的少，所以对于知识点的运用非常的缺乏。经过了几乎一个暑假的荒废，我已经忘了很多的知识，所以抱着来唤醒回忆的目的来参加这个活动。</p>
<p>这个活动的流程主要是使用python的语言来分析博主的情感状态，这是用数据分析的方法来获得准确的情感状态。首先拿到这个题目的时候是我非常是一头雾水的，毫无头绪，因为我并不知道这是让我们干什么。还好有老师给我们分析这个题目，这个题目主要就是把单词和符号分离，然后把所有的句子分析归类，来找到表达情感状态的单词，从而来表达人物的情感状态。</p>
<p>在一开始，我只能先看老师的演示程序来试图理解这个分析的流程。通过程序的报错来发现问题，渐渐的，我开始慢慢回忆一些学过的知识点，所以我翻看书来回忆学过却遗忘的知识点，根据书上的例子来运用到我们的题目中去，我发现可以有效的回忆和使用以前遗忘的知识点来编写程序了。但是由于重新拾起的缘故，所以我在进行得过程中出现了很多无法自己解决的报错问题，在学长的细心指导下，我才能一直畅通的进行下去。</p>
<p>通过这次的活动，让我重新温习了一些已经遗忘了的知识。python是一门需要练习的学问，想要能够完美的学习会python，光靠老师的讲解和书上例题的演示是远远不够的，只有不断的练习巩固和操练才能真正的掌握。由于平时的学业，能够使用到python 的时机也是非常的少的，这样的活动不仅让我能巩固我的编程知识，还让我来认识和了解到大学的python作业是什么样的，对于我未来的申请肯定是有很大帮助的。我希望我能够多参加这样的活动，让我的python知识不是只存在于书本而是真正的对我起到发展性的作用。</p>

        <p>As I have went into the AS，this is the time of me to be the leader of one club. The words I want to say is the club I set this year-the eight-valley club.</p>
<p>I want to record the activity we took last week, and this was the first time I had one club activity as the leader. This club was set to do the commercial program and the central idea of our club is new retail.</p>
<p>During the first activity, we have the about three parts. The first part is to introduce our club culture and the logo of our club. The second part is to let students to introduce themselves and know about each other together. The third part is to introduce them the idea of the new retail and this can help them know about our club better and give a better performance in the later club activities. Then, we gave students the tasks they need to do due to the next club activity.</p>
<p>Because I haven’t had any experience before, and I found that I have some problems in this activity. First of all, the problem of the facilities. Our principal required us to put our electronic equipment in his office. Because this was the first time, I didn’t know that I have to take it at the nine period. I thought that he will go home at the same time after school. As a result, my laptop was locked in his office. Then, during the time when students introduce themselves, they felt very shy, so this part wasn’t so successful. In addition, during the time of the we introduce our club because we waste some time to find the facilities. As a result, we have to rush the introduction, so I think our club members didn’t know our club very clearly.</p>
<p>Form the first activity, I decided to do some measures to improve the quality of our activity. To take the facility in time is really important. Then, to introduce our club again during the second activity in order to let our members to know the club better. Then, setting more interesting games to let them know each other well.  </p>
