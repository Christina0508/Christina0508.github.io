        <p>​    Today，I just want to summarize this IELTS study life this week.I have already finished my IELTS lessons,I thought that although I have finished study, but I have to do more exercises to prepare for my tests.</p>
<p>​    As I am in the special time(as we all know that the novel coronavirus has broke out, so I have started my online study life.In this way, I have a liberty of my time, for example,I could do many extra exercises or prepare for my IELTS during the breaks.This week, I have realized that vocabularies are really important for my study, not only IELTS but also my IGCSE study.I have been in Jinling high school for one term, my vocabulary has increased a lot, I also tried to memorized the vocabularies regularly under the instructions of my teachers.However, when I did a lot of exercises, I have realized that my vocabulary was really poor, this was also a reason that I couldn’t overcome the challenges and got high marks in the IELTS mock exam.So I have determined my mind to recite words every day.I have one vocabulary book, although I had that bok since the beginning of this term.I haven’t had one plan to recite it regularly.I made up my plan carefully and I decided to execute since that day.</p>
<p>​    However, I found that it really not a easy thing to do.During the first two days , I could execute my plan successfully and I thought that it will really helpful for my study, I was full of confidence and passion.Until the third day, i found that I found this work was really boring and I hadn’t find ang help and I thought that my efforts and time was just wasted , because I haven’t had any effects that can be showed on my homework or on the exercise I did.I nearly have no courage to preservers in my plan.Moreover, I not only faced this challenge but also another challenge .I found that I coudn’t memorize the words I have recited.When I saw the words I recited yesterday,I couldn’t remember them, I just remenber that I have recited them , but I couldn’t remenber their menings.In this way, I had to review them over and over again,because I forgot them over and over ang in.I found that it really a frustrating thing,I thought that this deeply hit my confidence.</p>
<p>​    I was always a unyielding person, so I wanted to realise the target I set when I began my plan.In this way,the time i used far more beyond the time I set at the beginning,because I used a lot of time to review the words i have recited.However,yesterday I suddenly realized that I have recited a lot of pages ,I have really remembered a lot of words.</p>
<p>​    This was only a small summary of my this week’s IELTS study,I thought that I thought this was a rough process and I felt that I didn’t pay any attention to my achievements, I found that it was really difficult during the process ,I once have an intention to give up.I think that preserverance is really essential, if one person can persevere one thing,even is a simple thing, if he can do it for a long term, it will definitely reach an aim or can get some achievements.Another thing, i should do things with a clear plan, a plan will actually help me finish and get targets more effective.</p>
