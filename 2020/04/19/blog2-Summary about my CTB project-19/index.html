        <p>​    I had that project in the November of 2019.That project was a competition in fact, the competition was China Thinks Big.If we can get into the 10% of the whole country, we would be able to show our project in Shanghai.</p>
<p>​    Our team set up very late.I was the leader of our team.Some of my classmates had set up their team about one month earlier than our team.This was because the final time of setting up was about one month later than the first time.We didn’t made up our mind to do this project at very first.We wasted a lot of time to decide.This had caused us to lack of time to prepare our reports and research.At first, we set up team, but some time later, we had a difficulty deciding our title and the contents.We only have decided to do searches about psychology.However, we can’t decide wht certain title and extends we would research.In this way, we had different ideas and this cause friction between our team members.Luckily,we discussed about one afternoon,we finally synthesize the ideas we all, we have decided our title, it was wether negative emotions will cause high school students have social problems.This is related to ourselves.So, it may be easier for us to have researches.</p>
<p>​    Then, the problems we faced was the time nearly used up because we started late.So, it’s really serious for us to finish a report a very short time.The most shortest time was we have to finish one report in just one week.At first, we did very earnest,we wrote one report after discussing for a long time and we will ask our teachers to modificate for us,then we can submit it.However, later, we could only discuss for one time,then we have submit it.Although we discussed very earnestly, I thought we have a lot of extents can be improved.I was the leader of my team, but i found that this was really a tiring work.I had to remind my team members over and over again.They may not finish their work very effectively.I also had to read and modificate the articles the wrote.I even had to accept their low quality work.I couldn’t blame them for their halfheartedness,because I didn’t want this to influence our friendship.</p>
<p>​    However, later, I have thought myself, I soon realized that, even I was very tired, i have pay much for our team, my team members even didn’t noticed that at all.They couldn’t admit my efforts .In this way, I had done self-examination about my leader work.I thought that a leader may be should have prestige,I didn’t need to care about the friendship, because in the team, I was the leader.But in the daily life, i could also be a good friend, these are just two different things.I couldn’t put them together, so in some extends, although I did a lot of efforts , I wasn’t a good leader.Though this project,I have realized that the next time to be a leader where i should improve.</p>
<p>​    Another thing i have learned that it was before I started to do something, I have to make a research and decided my mind early.How to make up mind early?i have to learn carefully about the activity,I should be careful to the time and comments.Then, i have to estimate whether I need to do it, whether I have enough time to finish it carefully , what can I learn from this activity.This is really important.</p>
<p>​    Although this time my project failed, but I don’t that this worth nothing for me.In contrast, this project have gave me a lot of experience and the things I need to improve.So, in some extents, failure is a good teacher.</p>
