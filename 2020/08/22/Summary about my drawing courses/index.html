        <p>I have kept drawing since I was only a little girl. I always kept drawing as one hobby for myself and I always sticked to this hobby until I entered the ninth grade.</p>
<p>When I entered the eighth grade, I was very busy with my study and I not only had to have many courses in the school, but also need to take extra courses during the free time. As a result, I didn’t keep my frequency to go drawing courses once a week and I only went to there through the frequency of about two weeks once or even three weeks once. In this way, obviously, I didn’t get much practice and I became even lazier after that year. Since I entered the ninth grade and I became much busier of my study and I even couldn’t find any time to go drawing. Then, a second time I found one excuse for myself. I told myself that I would go and attend the courses if I could find any time free. However, the fact is that i found more time to finish my homework, my efficiency is lower than before I was. As a result, I couldn’t find any time free to attend the courses.</p>
<p>During this summer holiday, I haven’t taken any courses in the last one year and I found the students around me all have their hobbies. Then, I realized that I should have my own hobby as well. I decided to pick up my hobby and took the drawing courses and always sticked to it. So, I tried to finish my work and found some time to take the courses. However, when I took the course for the first time and then I felt that it was really struggling for me to draw as before, as I have forgotten about the skills I learnt before and it couldn’t find any fulfillment from the course again. I had an idea to give up it and I didn’t to waste my time anymore. However, my teacher told me that if i tried to practice for some lessons, I would find that It didn’t forget about anything, I just haven’t practiced it for a long time. As I have learned it for so many years before, I have a very good basic training and it will be very simple for me to pick up it very soon.</p>
<p>Then, a really amazing thing happened during the second lesson. When I just drawn myself during that lesson. This maybe something that seems to be unbelievable, but it was true that I suddenly learned that how to draw ,which meant I suddenly understand the method to draw and I even just know how to draw before, but I never understood that why I draw in that way. I thought that maybe this was because I have grown up even older and it has become very easy for me to draw. Just after several lessons, I found that the senescent when I drew before.</p>
<p>During this experience, I decided that I would stick to my hobby in the future even if I will be really busy with my study, I thought that maybe I could understand the meaning quicker if I didn’t give up it for one year. I think it’s a truth for all the matters, insistence is always important for everyone, I will remember it no matter I will do anything in the future.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddVDuq.jpg" alt="ddVDuq.jpg"><br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddZ9Vf.jpg" alt="ddZ9Vf.jpg"></p>
