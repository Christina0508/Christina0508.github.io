<p>title: A volunteer experience<br>date: 2020-06-23 09:32:31<br>tags: A volunteer experience</p>
<p>I would like to describe an experience which I went to the Ming Tomb Museum to have the volunteer test. This was the first time I had a volunteer test.</p>
<p>I want to record this experience because this experience was really special for me. Before entering the senior school, I have never had a so professional test for volunteer and this was the first time, I knew that to be a volunteer have so many requirements.  The teachers in the museum told us to recite explanatory words and talked these contents to the visitors.</p>
<p>This was really a big challenge for me, this was the first time I try to recite the words. At the that moment, I just entered the senior high school and I haven’t adapted the pace of life in the school and I was very busy at that time, I have to cope with the study and also different kinds of activities .As a result, I hardly find any time to recite  the articles as I was so tired very day. In addition, I didn’t know the stories and history very clearly, it was very difficult for me to remember them in a very short time.</p>
<p>I tried it very hard to recite it, but I couldn’t find so much time to do so. I recited for so long time until late in the night before I had to go to there have the test. I was afraid that I couldn’t pass the test. However, I still have one hope that the test may be not so strict, but I thought wrong, the teacher was so harsh, she let me to repeat the articles for several times and she seemed that wasn’t satisfied with me. I felt that I couldn’t pass it successfully and I was so nervous. However, the teacher  then said to me surprised me a lot .She said that this test was to be responsible for the visitors and we have to make sure that the stories we told to visitors were correct and we also have to make sure that the visitors’ experience was good,  in this way ,volunteers should have the etiquettes and the professional knowledge to make sure the visitors to have the good impression, she said that she have saw my efforts and she also said that I have to practice it for more times. I was so surprised that I have the test and I also understand and remember some ideas that I have known for the first time.</p>
<p>Through this test, I recites these articles not only for myself, I thought these knowledge was no importance for me , but I have known that this was for the visitors , to be a volunteer , not only to gain an award for myself but also to gain the happiness through bringing others good experience and knowledge. The main idea to be a volunteer is to experience the sharedness to others, the reward is not important at all. So, I will treat the volunteer work more seriously, I have practiced the articles for several times, I want to record memories of my volunteer work and the happiness I told others useful and interesting stories.</p>
