<p>title: Comentary<br>date: 2020-08-01 15:42:04<br>tags: Comentary about one article<br>Source of the article: <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn</a><br>Date the commentary written: July 31, 2020<br>Words count of the commentary: 803 words<br>Unit of the syllabus to which the article relates: Macroeconomics<br>Key concepts: tax, recover<br>                                            Article<br>              Tax    revenue    shows    signs    of    recovery<br>By ZHOU LANXU | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2020-07-18 07:58<br>A bank teller counts RMB banknotes at a bank branch in Hai’an of East China’s Jiangsu province, on June 24, 2020. [Photo/Sipa]<br>China’s fiscal revenue, which reported its first growth this year in June, returned to expansionary territory, enabling stronger fiscal support for the economy over the second half, experts said on Friday.<br>The government’s general budgeted revenue grew by 3.2 percent year-on-year last month, marking the first expansion this year, thanks to the recovery in business activity and imports, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.<br>Fiscal revenue has been in a rally since the second quarter of the year as the economy staged comeback growth from the shutdowns brought by the COVID-19 outbreak, said Liu Jinyun, an official with the ministry.<br>Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter, according to Liu.<br>The year-on-year slide in the value-added tax revenue, the biggest contributor to the country’s national coffer, narrowed by 19.1 percent for the January-June period, versus 23.6 percent for the first three months as production activities in the industrial sector continued to recover, Liu said.<br>“The positive growth in fiscal revenue is a reflection of the nation’s steady economic recovery as well as the stable operation of market entities,” said Yang Weiyong, an associate professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.<br>With the economy continuing to recover in the second half, fiscal revenue is expected to further rise and increase funds available for the government to support the economy, Yang said.<br>The country reported a 1.6 percent year-on-year contraction in GDP for the first half of the year on Thursday, recovering from the 6.8 percent plunge for the first quarter, while analysts expect China’s economic growth to come in at about 2 to 3 percent for the whole year.<br>Luo Zhiheng, former chief macroeconomic researcher at the Evergrande Research Institute, said the proactive fiscal policy has played a key role in facilitating the economic recovery, with targeted tax and fee cuts and relatively strong fiscal expenditure focused on combating the contagion, ensuring people’s livelihood and funding major construction projects.<br>The country’s fiscal spending in the first six months fell by 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 11.64 trillion yuan, slower than the drop in revenue, according to the ministry.Looking into the second half, Luo said the country is expected to accelerate fiscal spending and shore up domestic demand, with the recovery in fiscal revenue and money raised by government<br>bonds providing more funds.<br>China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month, the ministry said.<br>The country has also stepped up the issuance of the projected 3.75 trillion yuan worth of special local government bonds, which are mainly to fund infrastructure investment. A total of 2.24 trillion yuan worth of the bonds were issued as of Tuesday, with 85 percent of the money raised already be spent, the ministry said.<br>“The Chinese economy still faces the risk that the global spread of COVID-19 may hit external demand, threatening employment and the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises.<br>Extending supports to these areas will be the focus of fiscal policy in the coming months,” Luo said.<br>Nonetheless, analysts said it is unlikely that China will elevate the quota of special treasuries, given the need to prevent excessive stimulus from causing risk.<br>“To prevent the distortion in resource allocation, it is more advisable for China to further the tax and fee cut measures than issue more bonds to fund government-led investment,” Yang said.<br>                                            Commentary<br>                     How reducing tax revenue to help recover<br>Because of the rise of the novel coronavirus in the world, the recovery is the most important aim of China, in order to recover, linking to the concept tax which means that a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.I want to discuss whether it’s helpful for recovery and why it offers a helping hand to recover.<br>From the news, we can get that “Over the first half, fiscal revenue contracted by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 9.62 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion), narrowing from 14.3 percent for the first quarter.”In this way, we can know that the fiscal revenue of the first quarter of 2020 is more than that of the revenue of the second quarter. This may because the indirect tax and direct tax all decreases. Firstly, government gives back some tax to people that are directly charged from their salaries. Secondly, government may also reduce the prices of products especially the prices of<br>necessities. In this way, people will be more affordable for these products. As a result, people can balance their lives during the novel coronavirus.<br>—<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a81iWD.png" alt="a81iWD.png"><br>From Fig1，government imposes a tax on the supply . The supply curve shifts to the left. In addition, many people cannot work during the virus period and some people even lose their jobs, so the demand for people to buy things will decrease because they may prefer to save their money as they have no confidence for the future. The demand curve will also shift to the left. When quantity is certain, the tax revenue is the quantity multiply the price difference, so the tax revenue before the coronavirus is tax revenue 1 which is the dark bule block, and the tax revenue during the virus is the tax revenue 2 which is the light blue block.<br>In July, the fiscal revenue of China showed the first time to recover, this was because the recovery of imports and the recovery of business activity. From the news, we can get that “China has decided to issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries for COVID-19 control efforts this year. As of Thursday, a total of 720 billion yuan of the bonds had been issued, with the rest to be issued by the end of this month.” In order to support the further recovery, the government has issued 1 trillion yuan in special treasuries to help state-owned business. Issuing money cannot help recovering very well. Government help these companies, so these companies can continue to produce instead of going bankrupt. This also decreases the costs of the products. As a result, the prices of products will decrease, people will be more affordable for them. The economic growth can grow. However, issuing money cannot help recovering very well, because of the virus, although people can be more affordable for products, they may have no confidence for the future, and they will save the money instead of spending money. As a result, money of government has wasted and has no effects. In this way, there is little help for recovery. In addition, issuing the money may lead the distortion in resource allocation because it’s difficult for the government to estimate how much money to give which sector, so it’s difficult to spend money effectively.<br>From the news, the writer points out that reducing tax revenue is a better way to help recover than issuing the money to help business activities. If government reduces the tax revenue, not only the prices of the products reduce, but also people’s salaries increase (both direct tax and indirect tax). In this way, people will have money to afford products. Although we may face the same problem, that’s people with no confidence about future, government may face a different situation. Imposing tax is a method which is used in the long run. People can’t get much money from tax immediately. As a result, they may choose to save money recently, but they will spend money in long run.<br>In the Fig2, if government reduces the tax revenue, people will have the incentives to buy things. In this way, people’s demand will increase, so the demand curve shifts to the right.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/a813lQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/01/a813lQ.png" alt="a813lQ.png"></a><br>In conclusion, issuing the money is easy to get to lead the distortion in resource allocation, so reduce tax revenue may be is a more reasonable method to help recovery. However, is very difficult for people to get much money through reducing the tax, so in long run this method may be is a good way to help recovery.</p>

<p>title:  Stage summary from 7.1 to 7.20<br>date: 2020-07-24 21:36:49<br>tags: Stage summary from 7.1 to 7.20<br>I would like to describe my life in these twenty days, the following summary includes three parts.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to talk about my results in these days. First of all, in my IELTS study, I continued to do exercises three times a week. I thought this part was normal because I did these exercises as usual. I will have a real IELTS test next month, so I’m preparing for it. During these days, I haven’t found any efforts in my points, I find that I may feel tired because of the longtime exercises, so I have to adjust myself to a better condition. In this way, maybe I can get a better point next month. Secondly, in my school study, I have done some preview sections, I have previewed three chapters of Chemistry, one chapter of Physics and two chapters of Math (Pure1). I have also had two economic lessons and one easy- commentary about a piece of news. Then, I have updated my blog once a week. In addition, I also had three python lessons every week to continue my coding part.</p>
<p>Then, I’d like to talk about my plan of next twenty days. The most important thing is to pass my IELTS test, I hope this part can be finished soon. I don’t want to delay it for so long time. This will let me more tired and more difficult to pass it. I plan to memory more words to help me cope with speaking and wring part. Next, I plan to continue preview next term’s books. My plan is to preview two chapters of each subject and I think I have to do some exercises. During last twenty days, I haven’t done many exercises because I haven’t learned much about new book. However, I think it’s really an important part of my preview part. In addition, I think I will write another commentary about news next twenty days after taking some lessons. Exercises can help me to consolidate the knowledge, this will help me to do better next term. Then, I plan to continue updating my blog once a week. I will also continue to have python lessons every week. Then, I think I will have a new part next twenty days, I think I will have some activities to enrich myself.</p>
<p>Summer holiday is one essential part for one year. I have done much in these twenty days and I hope I can do better in next twenties. I think I can plan and control my time in more effective way because actually I have wasted much time in this twenty days.</p>

<p>title: Commentary<br>date: 2020-07-18 14:50:52<br>tags: Comentary about one article(news)<br>Source of the article: <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn</a><br>Date the commentary written:  July 18, 2020<br>Words count of the commentary: 927 words<br>Unit of the syllabus to which the article relates: Microeconomics<br>Key concepts: scarcity, shortage and economic well-being<br>                                                                                Article<br>                                                           Water quenches thirst for growth<br>By Fang Aiqing in Beijing and Hu Dongmei in Pengyang, Ningxia | China Daily | Updated: 2020-06-13 09:14<br> Over the past decade, Ningxia has been prioritizing the resolution to provide rural areas with safe drinking water. Reliable supply transforms once barren area into a hive of productivity and profit.</p>
<p>With the help of automation and smart technology, residents of one of China’s driest areas are getting affordable clean water instead of yearning for rainfall.</p>
<p>It took people living in the central and south of Ningxia Hui autonomous region nearly 40 years to complete this arduous journey.</p>
<p>“In the past, we had to pour the water into the jar and let it settle before drinking it,” says Li Xiaoqin, a villager at Chengyang village of Pengyang county in the southeast of the autonomous region.<br>Zhang Shixiang, Party secretary of the village, says they used to carry water two kilometers to home, and it took two hours just to get the water.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have drinking water, let alone water to shower,” Li says, adding that they now have tap water not only to drink and shower, but also to clean the house, water the flowers, feed livestock, and importantly, flush the toilet.<br> Experts from the Ministry of Water Resources visit Pengyang county in the southeast of the autonomous region. </p>
<p>Today, the nearly 200,000 people living in the countryside of Pengyang, can, through phone access, check water quality and pay fees. Crucially, water charges are the same as those for townsfolk.</p>
<p>The southern mountainous area of the autonomous region, including where the county is located, is often referred to as Xihaigu.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, it was a dry and rainless place where barren hills stretched on and on and ravines and gullies crisscrossed. Groundwater was scarce.</p>
<p>Water resource per capita was less than one-sixth of the average amount nationwide, according to Jiang Qi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and director of the institute for desertification control at the Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences.</p>
<p>Scarcity of water had once been a constraint for the region’s high-quality development, he says.<br>A regional government document on poverty alleviation released in September 2016 shows that rain-fed farming accounted for 90 percent of total farmlands in underdeveloped areas of the autonomous region, and 80 percent of the cultivated land yielded not much and unsteadily.</p>
<p>Yet, annual rainfall of the county ranges from 350 to 550 millimeters, around one-third of the amount of evaporation, and rainfall from July through September takes up more than 60 percent of the whole year, making the situation in other seasons even worse, according to a government introduction of Pengyang’s natural geographic features.</p>
<p>However, with a stable water source now, the locals are actively planting red plum apricots (a local specialty), pepper, edible mushrooms and Chinese medical herbs, and also raising chickens, bees, cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>Niu Detan, general manager of the county’s water supply management company, says some locals who used to work outside have come back to run breeding businesses, or operate greenhouses and plant orchards.</p>
<p>People’s income is growing every year, Niu says.<br>All this is thanks to a water transfer project that makes it possible for more than one million people of the Xihaigu area to access safe drinking water since 2016.</p>
<p>The project transfers water from the Jinghe River by the east foot of the Liupan Mountain in southern Ningxia. The river is a tributary of the Weihe River, which, itself, is a tributary of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Based on the project, the county government of Pengyang invested further to integrate updated internet technology specially to improve the quality and stability of water supply in rural areas.</p>
<p>Zhang admitted that facilities didn’t work well at first and water quality was not satisfying.<br>The county later transformed the facilities in the reservoir, the pump station and the pipe network, and equipped every household with smart water meters, which enables real-time video monitoring of the whole water supply process, as well as remote control and management on computer and phone.</p>
<p>The water management staff can monitor the PH value and turbidity of the water online. Once there’s a breakdown, the system would automatically sound the alarm and distribute maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>According to Niu, if there were a communication failure at the pump station, the system inside the station would be able to supply water steadily for at least a week.</p>
<p>The intelligent facilities have solved the problem of high cost and management difficulty caused by rural households being numerous but scattered, Jiang says.</p>
<p>Therefore, water fees are lowered in these underdeveloped villages where pipelines have to go through mountains and ditches.</p>
<p>As Ningxia has already built a unified online platform before to manage water conservancy information, and facilities to provide internet access for rural areas, the county doesn’t have to invest much on internet infrastructure for the transformation such as server and the machine room, nor the data operation and security issues, according to Niu.<br>Over the past decade, Ningxia has been prioritizing the resolution to provide rural areas with safe drinking water. Tap water penetration has risen from 26 percent at the end of 2006 to 90 percent by 2019.</p>
<p>“We have historically solved the problem of water shortage and covered the barren hills with green,” says Ma Hancheng, vice-chairman of the autonomous region and a deputy to the National People’s Congress at a recent interview with chinanews.com.<br>Ningxia is now seeking to promote the intelligent water supply facilities of Pengyang to the whole region and is determined to provide replicable and referential experience for the country, where freshwater resource is much limited and distributes unevenly.<br>The region is calling for more financial and policy support from the country, according to a recent proposal from the region’s water conservancy department.<br>Commentary<br>Problem of water scarcity<br>Residents of some areas of China are yearning for rainfall, people don’t have water to support their basic lives, linking to the concept scarcity which means the state of being scarce or in short supply or shortage, they can’t get affordable clean water. I need to explore the causes of the issue and before I discuss whether automation and smart technology is an effective and sustainable way to solve the problem of water scarcity.</p>
<p>In one of China’s driest areas is lack of water and it also means the this area face a<br>shortage which means situation in which something needed cannot to b obtained in sufficient amounts. In this area, it extremely lacks underground water and rain. It took people living in the central and south of Ningxia Hui autonomous region nearly 40 years to complete this arduous journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/18/Ugl3b8.png" alt="Ugl3b8.png"></p>
<p>From Fig1, we can see that because of the population increases, the demand for water also expands as water is a kind of necessities，so demand curve shifts to the right. However, this place is rain less, so the supply of water decreases, so the supply curve shifts to the left, this will cause a gap between the Qd and Qs, this means the shortage of water and there is a tendency of price rising.</p>
<p>There exists the necessity for government to intervene and why we use this method, how to use this method and the disadvantages of this method. This problem of scarcity of water need to be solved because water is a kind of necessities, and people use tap water not only to drink and shower, but also to clean the house, water the flowers, feed livestock, and importantly, flush the toilet. If people’s necessities cannot be satisfied, they may have low level of living standard. In this way, this will increase the poverty of this area and the country which means the state of being extremely poor. So if we use automation and smart technology to solve the problem of water scarcity, people in poor areas can use water in their daily life and they can also use water to grow crops in order to support their living expenses, so their economic well-being will increase which is defined as having present and future financial security.</p>
<p>From the graph, we can see the change of the demand and supply curve. The demand curve doesn’t change because water is a kind of necessities, and people’s demand is stable. The supply curve shifts to the right because the automation and smart technology helps transports water to the area.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/18/UglWx1.png" alt="UglWx1.png"></p>
<p>Then, I want to discuss how to use this method. In order to solve the problem of scarcity, the meaning of using this system is to transport the water from places in the south where water is very sufficient to the places where water is really scarce. However, the facilities to solve the water problem is really expensive and difficult to build. From the news, we can get that that area used 40 years to operate the system properly. So, we can get that it took so long time to operate the systems. In addition, the cost of using this system is very high. This is due to that the water fees in poor areas are lower than other areas because government in order to reduce the poverty. However, the facilities to solve the water problem is really expensive and difficult to build.</p>
<p>However, the method which uses automation and smart technology to solve the water problem has many disadvantages. Ignoring the disadvantages which are mentioned in the fourth paragraph, we will talk about the results the after using this method. The most significant one is that the quality of water can’t be guaranteed, and the stability of water is not very high. As a result, people may face the problem that the quality of water is very low, and this will lead people to have health problems and low stability will cause the living conditions of people to be influenced.</p>
<p> As a result, I need to discuss how to solve the issue of this method. If government wants to popularize the technology<br> and use it in different areas in the country, it needs a long time and huge amount of money. If government wants to<br> improve the quality and stability of water, this will use more time and money. In order to solve this problem, the only<br> way is to solve this problem is to give more money. As a result, this is link to the government revenue, definitely<br> government will give money. However, government may have to move money from other areas to solve water<br> scarcity，this will have an opportunity cost and government may have to increase the tax in order to increase the<br> government revenue. As a result, this is related to the government policies，government need to change policies to<br> achieve the aim.</p>
<p>In long run, using automation and smart technology to solve this problem isn’t a sustainable solution. Although we can solve some certain areas’ issues of water scarcity, we need to use very arduous ways. In fact, government can’t have so much money in a short time ，how much more the method use so much money has so many drawbacks. In conclusion, government needs to find more effective ways.</p>

<p>Markov model：<br>Conditional probability P (wi|wi-1)</p>
<p>P (wi - 1, wi)/P (wi - 1)</p>
<p>Joint probability, edge probability</p>
<p>F (wi-1, WI)=#(wi-1, WI)/# relative frequency</p>
<p>F (wi) = # (wi - 1) / #</p>
<p>According to the big data theorem, statistics are enough</p>

<p>title: A volunteer experience<br>date: 2020-06-23 09:32:31<br>tags: A volunteer experience</p>
<p>I would like to describe an experience which I went to the Ming Tomb Museum to have the volunteer test. This was the first time I had a volunteer test.</p>
<p>I want to record this experience because this experience was really special for me. Before entering the senior school, I have never had a so professional test for volunteer and this was the first time, I knew that to be a volunteer have so many requirements.  The teachers in the museum told us to recite explanatory words and talked these contents to the visitors.</p>
<p>This was really a big challenge for me, this was the first time I try to recite the words. At the that moment, I just entered the senior high school and I haven’t adapted the pace of life in the school and I was very busy at that time, I have to cope with the study and also different kinds of activities .As a result, I hardly find any time to recite  the articles as I was so tired very day. In addition, I didn’t know the stories and history very clearly, it was very difficult for me to remember them in a very short time.</p>
<p>I tried it very hard to recite it, but I couldn’t find so much time to do so. I recited for so long time until late in the night before I had to go to there have the test. I was afraid that I couldn’t pass the test. However, I still have one hope that the test may be not so strict, but I thought wrong, the teacher was so harsh, she let me to repeat the articles for several times and she seemed that wasn’t satisfied with me. I felt that I couldn’t pass it successfully and I was so nervous. However, the teacher  then said to me surprised me a lot .She said that this test was to be responsible for the visitors and we have to make sure that the stories we told to visitors were correct and we also have to make sure that the visitors’ experience was good,  in this way ,volunteers should have the etiquettes and the professional knowledge to make sure the visitors to have the good impression, she said that she have saw my efforts and she also said that I have to practice it for more times. I was so surprised that I have the test and I also understand and remember some ideas that I have known for the first time.</p>
<p>Through this test, I recites these articles not only for myself, I thought these knowledge was no importance for me , but I have known that this was for the visitors , to be a volunteer , not only to gain an award for myself but also to gain the happiness through bringing others good experience and knowledge. The main idea to be a volunteer is to experience the sharedness to others, the reward is not important at all. So, I will treat the volunteer work more seriously, I have practiced the articles for several times, I want to record memories of my volunteer work and the happiness I told others useful and interesting stories.</p>

<p>title: EV商学院路演小结<br>date: 2020-06-18 22:56:12<br>tags: Ev 商学院路演小结<br>前段时间去看了EV商学院的路演，看到学长学姐的项目的汇报，有良多感触，有收益也有思考。</p>
<p>首先，这场路演分为A，B两组主要是关于飞跃公司设计一个线下快闪店。为十分的惊异于学长学姐的设计以及思考。首先第一组，最让我有感触的是第一组的设计，为认为设计非常的精妙，设计引导消费者不管怎样都直接走到店内，店内全自动的销售和制作方式之分新颖，店内虽然不大却使用非常的精妙的原理来增大空间，店外部使用十分精妙的灯光设计，来吸引消费者，圆形的设计非常的有设计感，来增加的消费者的消费量。其中赛博朋克的设计非常的的吸引我，使用了全球时尚界十分有名的设计来设计可以给消费者带来新鲜感和购买冲动得雨屋，以及产品中融合了中国水墨的元素十分的有特色，水转印的技术也十分的吸引人，简单易行而且设计出独一无二的产品是吸引年轻消费者的一大特色。第二组的红外线设计和数据分析十分精妙，通过红外线的装置来观测人群是十分前沿的想法。然后，他们想要采用时下潮流的电商和游戏动漫联名来吸引消费者也是十分有趣的想法。</p>
<p>通过了路演，为非常钦佩学长学姐的能力和想法，这两组各显神通各有千秋，但是我也发现了两组有一个共同性的问题，就是经费和方便问题，其中第一组的设计固然精妙，但是自动化的装置的价格确实不菲，而且作为一个快闪店，流动性也要考虑到其中，不知道复杂的设计会不会有问题产生。而第二组去的想法首先红外线装置是十分神奇的，而我们可以看到的是电商固然是一个十分有效的方法，但是呢，电商和联名的方法，别的企业也能想到也可以做同样的尝试，而且对于电商的的邀请是十分严格的，也许有名的电商才能带来足够多的收益，但是很显然，这样的电商的价格是十分昂贵的，所以又回到了资金的问题，我认为这一点是十分重要的，实用性也要考虑到设计中去。</p>
<p>经过了此次路演，让我钦佩学长学姐们，他们的设计真的是非常的有创意而且很丰富,但是也并非十分完美，让我的感触是，所有的设计都是需要不断改进的，都是要考虑全面的，没有完美的设计，只有不断的进步。</p>

<p>title: 代言中的奥秘<br>date: 2020-06-14 11:10:30<br>tags: 时尚篇2<br>—代言中的奥秘<br>在上一篇中，提到了杂志的销售情况与代言息息相关。当一本杂志在线预售时，就会有粉丝购买，他们的购买意图是为自己的偶像获得更好的商业资源。</p>
<p>通过线上预售的方式，杂志方可以得到电子的销售数据，而这些数据就是提供给各大品牌方的资料，微博粉丝数量都不能说明什么，只有数据可以说明商业价值，评价一个明星是否是实红就是他的粉丝会不会为他买单，粉丝和流量是评价一个明星的层次的中重要依据（一线，二线等）而这与商业价值中的测层次确实大不相同的，在商业价值有会为明星评价一个明星新的依据。</p>
<p>以陈伟霆为例，他是一个典型的商业价值非常高的艺人，冰淇淋-中街1946在2019年一年的销售额大约为一亿元，已经是冷饮中的爆款，在2020年5月10日官宣陈伟霆作为代言人的当天的销售额为两千万，可见陈伟霆的带货能力之强，而我们可以看到陈伟霆的微博粉丝数量并不是特别的多，与流量明星相比相差很多，在各大数据榜单上也并没有很靠前的位置，但是他的商业价值非常的高，例如他曾经在同一时期代言两款手机，oppo和国美plus，代言香飘飘的饮品和卫岗酸奶和百威啤酒。一般来说品牌方会避免请对手品牌的代言人做代言，同样的代言人就失去了竞争力，而陈伟霆同时代言两款手机，还代言多款饮品，说明了品牌方评估了陈伟霆的商业价值，认为他在为竞争对手代言的同时可以为他们的产品带来很好的收益经过和其他明星的对比。显而易见，更好的，更高端的品牌会找到更具有商业价值更红的明星来做代言。</p>
<p>那为什么明星的商业价值会有这么大的差异，为什么很多大流量的商业价值很低，而且接到的代言都是低档次的日常用品饮品食品呢？这与粉丝的受众群体十分相关。市场上的大流量大部分都有个特点，低龄，这与正是他们能够成为流量的原因，低龄的人群更容易被吸引成为粉丝，他们的粉丝大多数人都是学生，学生经济不独立，家长很难给他们足够的钱来满足为偶像消费的需求，让他们只能成为不消费的粉丝，也就是死粉，可以认定为没有购买力的，但他们又是那些流量明星的流量来源。这些低龄的粉丝只能够购买价格便宜的商品，所以那些廉价的生活用品就成为了流量明星的代言。而像陈伟霆这样年龄的明星，粉丝的受众群体大都是经济独立的女性，他们可以支配自己的资金，他们需要在生活中购买一些奢侈用品，例如陈伟霆就是香奈儿的代言人。这就成为了他们商业的依据，也就铸造成了粉丝数和商业价值的巨大差异。</p>
<p>代言和杂志中的奥秘，我暂时分解这么多，更多资讯敬请期待。</p>

<p>title:  杂志封面人物的内涵<br>date: 2020-05-31 10:19:46<br>tags:  时尚篇1<br>—我一直都有喜欢帅哥的兴趣，高伟光一直是我关注的一个演员，但一直是不温不火，这个寒假里终于由于《三生三世枕上书》一剧而小火了一把，于是他终于有了饭圈里的一线杂志首封。</p>
<p>高伟光封面的这本杂志是《费加罗Madame Figaro Mode》五月刊，而这本杂志在五月也出版了其他明星的封面杂志，这让我十分奇怪，五月同时出几位封面人物的杂志，如何能体现出特别，同样是这本书准一线杂志的封面，明星的人气差距却显而易见，为何会有如此大的区别，同样是一本杂志，如何使粉丝如此的在意这本一线杂志社的销量。</p>
<p>经过对比后，我发现这几本封面人物不同的杂志，其实虽说都是同一本杂志，但是本质上却十分的不同。以费加罗为例，费加罗本身属于在杂志分类中的女刊，并非男刊，虽然经常请女明星作为封面人物，但是也会请男明星有作为正刊的封面人物，而我们之前所说的五月刊的正刊的封面为黄子韬，众所周知的大众流量明星。而高伟光封面的这一版是的Mode的特别刊，所谓Mode刊并非正刊，相当于我们常说的副刊，所以封面的人物会咖位会比正刊人物小但是又比二线杂志的封面人物的咖位要大。而特别刊并非简单的Mode刊，而是为了某个特定的主题·，或是某个特定的人物而出版的。而体现在杂志上的不同为，普通的Mode刊只有一版的封面，而特别刊有a，b两版的封面,而且限量发售，所以显而易见，特别刊的人物咖位比普通Mode刊要大，但是却小于正刊人物。此外，费加罗本身为一本女刊，但是在每年的四月和十月都会出一本男刊，此男刊为正刊，封面上会有Hommes的字样，体现为男刊，这本与前面说到的女刊的正刊同等分量，人物咖位相当。</p>
<p>杂志将不同的刊号分的十分精细，是因为，在复杂的娱乐圈中，所谓的明星，其中有非常重要的一项为商业价值，那怎么样才能够最合理的评估商业价值，那么就要用到杂志的帮助了，根据明星的粉丝数量和活跃程度，以及电视剧电影的作品的热度，也就是本人实力和流量，杂志方会根据这些邀请明星作为杂志封面，很显而易见，一线杂志邀请到的为一线明星，而二线杂志则为二线明星，但这些都是杂志方根据上述的各种标准得到的评估，那么此时会出现所为的“实红”和“水红”。刚刚说到，这些杂志是限量发售的，但是其实方法为预售，预售就是在杂志就还没有印刷出来之前先以网络购买的方式来销售。以这样的方法可以方便评估实际印刷的本数，防止印刷出来后卖不掉，因为经常有粉丝数量多，但是销售量一直上不去的名星，这就是粉丝不愿意为他们买单的结果，也就是上面提到的名词“水红”。这就是杂志为了防止这种情况发生的措施。而且在饭圈中有一个词叫做“秒切”，这个词的意思就是在几秒钟的时间之内将预售的数量售罄，因为这些将作为数据。</p>
<p>这些售卖的数据尤为重要，是因为这些是这些明星的商业价值的评估，这些销售数据将提供给各大品牌，作为数据参考，所以粉丝希望自己的偶像发展的更好，就会非常努力的创造数据，而这些数据的重要性当然也随着杂志等级的增加而增加，而具体数据发挥的作用及代言中的奥妙，且听下回分解。</p>

<p>title: 数学之美第二章读书笔记<br>date: 2020-05-24 20:43:46<br>tags: 数学之美第二章读书笔记<br>— ——自然语言处理<br>字母，文字，数字都是编码单位。一种语言就是一种编码的方式，语法就是解编码的算法。语言的数学本质就是通过编码来表达信息。虽说动物也能传递信息，但是直邮人类利用语言传递信息是人类的本质。随着计算机的出现，机器也可以用人类的方式处理和传递语言。智能就是人和机器交流，当人能够和机器交流时，说明这个机器就是智能了。</p>
<p>许多的科学家认为机器能够翻译或者识别等人类做的事，首先是要了解人类语言，而这一点是错误的，是因为计算机能够解释和做人类做的事，全都是因为数学，数学中的统计。而我们计算机语言的核心就是能够理解语法规则，就是对自然语言的处理。分析句子的文法被科学家用做规则来书写。所以高级程序语言的规则和自然语言的规则看上去很相似。然后人们分析更复杂的句子就要用从一维变成二维了，我们无法将图画出来，所以单纯对语言分析器已经无法分析这么复杂的语句了。但是即使写出所有自然语言对合集也无法用计算机来表示所有。即使是很规则的方法也不能分析一些真实语句。</p>
<p>自然界中很多的多义词很难用规则来描述，这就是计算机对难处，很多的意思依赖于上下文，或者常识。于是便从规则到了统计，用统计的办法使计算机的识别率大大提高。基于同统计的方法只能浅层次的理解自然语言，而无法从深层次研究。由于计算机能力的提高和数据量的增加，渐渐的分析复杂句子变成了可能，大家发现运用统计得到的句法比语言学家总结的更加的有道理。所以用数学处理自然语言。而科学家的新老交替才带来了发展。所以数学意模型和通讯是相通的，科学家们花了几十年来理解期中的联系。</p>

<p>title:  数学之美第一章读书笔记<br>date: 2020-05-16 13:49:28<br>tags:  第一章读书笔记<br>一开始拿到这本书的时候，数学之美，我的第一反应可能是对于数学的学术的研究，也有可能是对数学定理的解释，我先阅读了序言部分，对于序言部分，这本书主要写了作者对于数学以及信息处理方面的专业学科的理解，是一本深入浅出的书，既照顾了普通读者的兴趣又兼顾了专业读者对深度的要求。这样的介绍让我对这本书学之美有了初步的认识。对于书的前言部分，首先是刷新我对于这本书的认识，因为数学是一个神秘的学科，但是书中提出了数学是十分真实的，因为数学的演化过程实际是将我们生活中遇到的具体事物及其运动的规律不断抽象化的过程。数学并不是在现实中无法运用的，也并不是我们想象中的木讷二十我们生活中经常可以得以运用的，生活中的数学无处不在，我们日常使用的产品都有数学的存在。数学和语言通信也就是信息息息相关。因为要用数学解决和信息相关的许多内容，这就是数学之美。从古至今，通信无处不在，充斥着整个世界，不论是现在的人们离不开网络还是古代的人与人之间的基本交流，都受着数学规律的支配。虽然数学看起来很深奥但是实际上是简单而直接的，所以这本书主要是说简单即是美，来讲述数学之美。</p>
<p>数学，文字和自然语言都是信息的载体，他们之有着天然的联系。这是我之前所未能想到的，我一直不觉得语言和数学有什么联系，所以，语言和数学是为了同一目的，记录和传播信息。当我们在古代时就已经传播信息了，哪怕只是奇怪是叫声，也是信息的一种类型。语言只是因为越来越多的信息产生而出现。那么文字和数学之间的联系呀是十分奇妙的，文字的出现只是为了高效的记录信息。文字的发展是随着信息量的增加而产生的，所以也就可以解释为什么甲骨文发展成为现代的汉字，而在今日，在古代很长一段时间所不能完成的事情，现在在很短的时间里就可以处理很大数量的文字，因为有了不同型号的计算机。为什么我们能够理解古代的文字是因为文字是不重要的，重要的是信息本身。所以得出的结论是我们用不同的语言是为了保护信息的安全，因为用不同的语言，解释同一件事才能够让更加增进我们的理解，也许可以用一种语言解释另外一种。所以现代是同样的道理，不需要像古代一样繁琐的原因是我们有了更先进的数学工具和计算机。记数系统的产生仅仅是因为需要记数的物品越来越多，而记数系统的基础是数学。而我们使用十进制仅仅是因为人有十根手指，早期的人们是用掰手指来记数的。而我们使用阿拉伯数字是因为这种方法比中国人发明的个十百千万和罗马数字来的方便。而文字背后的数学是人们懒惰的使用不同的字母比使用象形文字来的方便，也就是现在的拼音文字。而古代的校验方法和现代与是相同的，只不过在表达上比一起更准确和丰富。今日我们的学者在研究自然语言时已经自发的在外面祖先设计语言之处用类似的方法解决现在的问题。古代和现代的相似之处有着的共同的东西就是数学规律。</p>
