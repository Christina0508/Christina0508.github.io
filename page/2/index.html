        <p>作为一个编程小白，我在大概三个月前才开始学习python。起初的初衷是因为python如此的火爆，已经成为现如今流行的存在。由于未来专业方向的缘故，python的学习能为我未来的学习省下许多的力气。首先，Python是一门解释性语言，这是他的特点，这让Python似乎与“高效”无缘。然而你知道吗，著名的Instagram服务器就是是用Python+Django搭建的，而且月活用户超过7亿。要知道Python+Django是一个以速度慢著称的web框架，一定是python的某个优点深深的吸引了他们。是的，这个优点就是，开发效率高。</p>
<p>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.<br>   –摘自Python官网<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.python.org</a></p>
<p>由于在此之前，可以说我几乎从未接触过编程，所以在进行时，可是说是比较艰难，而且由于在平时的学习中几乎用不到编程，所以我练习的机会非常的少，所以对于知识点的运用非常的缺乏。经过了几乎一个暑假的荒废，我已经忘了很多的知识，所以抱着来唤醒回忆的目的来参加这个活动。</p>
<p>这个活动的流程主要是使用python的语言来分析博主的情感状态，这是用数据分析的方法来获得准确的情感状态。首先拿到这个题目的时候是我非常是一头雾水的，毫无头绪，因为我并不知道这是让我们干什么。还好有老师给我们分析这个题目，这个题目主要就是把单词和符号分离，然后把所有的句子分析归类，来找到表达情感状态的单词，从而来表达人物的情感状态。</p>
<p>在一开始，我只能先看老师的演示程序来试图理解这个分析的流程。通过程序的报错来发现问题，渐渐的，我开始慢慢回忆一些学过的知识点，所以我翻看书来回忆学过却遗忘的知识点，根据书上的例子来运用到我们的题目中去，我发现可以有效的回忆和使用以前遗忘的知识点来编写程序了。但是由于重新拾起的缘故，所以我在进行得过程中出现了很多无法自己解决的报错问题，在学长的细心指导下，我才能一直畅通的进行下去。</p>
<p>通过这次的活动，让我重新温习了一些已经遗忘了的知识。python是一门需要练习的学问，想要能够完美的学习会python，光靠老师的讲解和书上例题的演示是远远不够的，只有不断的练习巩固和操练才能真正的掌握。由于平时的学业，能够使用到python 的时机也是非常的少的，这样的活动不仅让我能巩固我的编程知识，还让我来认识和了解到大学的python作业是什么样的，对于我未来的申请肯定是有很大帮助的。我希望我能够多参加这样的活动，让我的python知识不是只存在于书本而是真正的对我起到发展性的作用。</p>

        <p>As I have went into the AS，this is the time of me to be the leader of one club. The words I want to say is the club I set this year-the eight-valley club.</p>
<p>I want to record the activity we took last week, and this was the first time I had one club activity as the leader. This club was set to do the commercial program and the central idea of our club is new retail.</p>
<p>During the first activity, we have the about three parts. The first part is to introduce our club culture and the logo of our club. The second part is to let students to introduce themselves and know about each other together. The third part is to introduce them the idea of the new retail and this can help them know about our club better and give a better performance in the later club activities. Then, we gave students the tasks they need to do due to the next club activity.</p>
<p>Because I haven’t had any experience before, and I found that I have some problems in this activity. First of all, the problem of the facilities. Our principal required us to put our electronic equipment in his office. Because this was the first time, I didn’t know that I have to take it at the nine period. I thought that he will go home at the same time after school. As a result, my laptop was locked in his office. Then, during the time when students introduce themselves, they felt very shy, so this part wasn’t so successful. In addition, during the time of the we introduce our club because we waste some time to find the facilities. As a result, we have to rush the introduction, so I think our club members didn’t know our club very clearly.</p>
<p>Form the first activity, I decided to do some measures to improve the quality of our activity. To take the facility in time is really important. Then, to introduce our club again during the second activity in order to let our members to know the club better. Then, setting more interesting games to let them know each other well.  </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I have kept drawing since I was only a little girl. I always kept drawing as one hobby for myself and I always sticked to this hobby until I entered the ninth grade.</p>
<p>When I entered the eighth grade, I was very busy with my study and I not only had to have many courses in the school, but also need to take extra courses during the free time. As a result, I didn’t keep my frequency to go drawing courses once a week and I only went to there through the frequency of about two weeks once or even three weeks once. In this way, obviously, I didn’t get much practice and I became even lazier after that year. Since I entered the ninth grade and I became much busier of my study and I even couldn’t find any time to go drawing. Then, a second time I found one excuse for myself. I told myself that I would go and attend the courses if I could find any time free. However, the fact is that i found more time to finish my homework, my efficiency is lower than before I was. As a result, I couldn’t find any time free to attend the courses.</p>
<p>During this summer holiday, I haven’t taken any courses in the last one year and I found the students around me all have their hobbies. Then, I realized that I should have my own hobby as well. I decided to pick up my hobby and took the drawing courses and always sticked to it. So, I tried to finish my work and found some time to take the courses. However, when I took the course for the first time and then I felt that it was really struggling for me to draw as before, as I have forgotten about the skills I learnt before and it couldn’t find any fulfillment from the course again. I had an idea to give up it and I didn’t to waste my time anymore. However, my teacher told me that if i tried to practice for some lessons, I would find that It didn’t forget about anything, I just haven’t practiced it for a long time. As I have learned it for so many years before, I have a very good basic training and it will be very simple for me to pick up it very soon.</p>
<p>Then, a really amazing thing happened during the second lesson. When I just drawn myself during that lesson. This maybe something that seems to be unbelievable, but it was true that I suddenly learned that how to draw ,which meant I suddenly understand the method to draw and I even just know how to draw before, but I never understood that why I draw in that way. I thought that maybe this was because I have grown up even older and it has become very easy for me to draw. Just after several lessons, I found that the senescent when I drew before.</p>
<p>During this experience, I decided that I would stick to my hobby in the future even if I will be really busy with my study, I thought that maybe I could understand the meaning quicker if I didn’t give up it for one year. I think it’s a truth for all the matters, insistence is always important for everyone, I will remember it no matter I will do anything in the future.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddVDuq.jpg" alt="ddVDuq.jpg"><br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/22/ddZ9Vf.jpg" alt="ddZ9Vf.jpg"></p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’d like to describe my first IELTS speaking test. I have prepared for my IELTS test for a long time. </p>
<p>Although I have taking several mock tests, I haven’t tried a real one before. In addition, there’s a huge difference between the mock exam and the real exam. First, it’s really official and I didn’t know the process of the test before. Second,    I have never had one speaking mock test before with one foreign teacher, so it’s easy for me to feel very nervous. Plus, this time I have to take this exam in the morning, so there’s less time for me to do psychological construction.</p>
<p>When I got the test center, the process of the exam was so complex, and I was frightened by that. I felt really nervous since I just got into the university where I took the test. I felt that a deer was running in my heart and I felt really bad. In order to let me calm down, I thought I have to do some measures. First, when I got in, I told myself that I can do it, there is no need for me to be afraid of this test, the foreign teachers just the same as Chinese teachers and they are all friendly. I just to have one talk with him not a test at all. I could calm down for some while. However, when I got into the building, all the students were followed the guidance of the teacher to sit outdoor of the classroom where you would take the test. All the students were waiting there until the examiner called them. I waited there for some while and all the students have been in the classroom. This is only me who still sited on the corridor and then the sense of fear came to me again. This time the way to talk to myself was not available. Then, I overcome one new idea immediately. I let myself to take several deep breaths and just look at the floor not the door. In this way, it really helps me slow down my heartbeat. </p>
<p>As a result, although I couldn’t let myself be calm as I am during the normal days, I could let myself not to be too nervous which would influence my condition during the speaking test. I still felt a little bit nervous during the test, but this didn’t matter too much. I could give out my opinion and talk to the examiner quite fluently. I think that maybe a little bit tension can help me do better in the test.</p>
<p>I think that although I haven’t known the score I got, I think this test is still meaningful for me. This is the first time I have one speaking test, I’ve developed some tips to help me overcome the psychological problems. I think that the most important isn’t that I got the ways to help myself, but to get the idea that I can overcome all the problems if I try my best. This time if I didn’t help myself, I couldn’t say a word to the examiner just because I’m afraid. If I meet some difficulties in the life, I have to try to overcome and solve it, not to try to escape it. Always try is the best solution.</p>

        <p>I would like to describe my life in these twenty days, the following summary includes three parts.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to talk about my results in these days. First of all, in my IELTS study, I continued to do exercises three times a week. I thought this part was normal because I did these exercises as usual. I will have a real IELTS test next month, so I’m preparing for it. During these days, I haven’t found any efforts in my points, I find that I may feel tired because of the longtime exercises, so I have to adjust myself to a better condition. In this way, maybe I can get a better point next month. Secondly, in my school study, I have done some preview sections, I have previewed three chapters of Chemistry, one chapter of Physics and two chapters of Math (Pure1). I have also had two economic lessons and one easy- commentary about a piece of news. Then, I have updated my blog once a week. In addition, I also had three python lessons every week to continue my coding part.</p>
<p>Then, I’d like to talk about my plan of next twenty days. The most important thing is to pass my IELTS test, I hope this part can be finished soon. I don’t want to delay it for so long time. This will let me more tired and more difficult to pass it. I plan to memory more words to help me cope with speaking and wring part. Next, I plan to continue preview next term’s books. My plan is to preview two chapters of each subject and I think I have to do some exercises. During last twenty days, I haven’t done many exercises because I haven’t learned much about new book. However, I think it’s really an important part of my preview part. In addition, I think I will write another commentary about news next twenty days after taking some lessons. Exercises can help me to consolidate the knowledge, this will help me to do better next term. Then, I plan to continue updating my blog once a week. I will also continue to have python lessons every week. Then, I think I will have a new part next twenty days, I think I will have some activities to enrich myself.</p>
<p>Summer holiday is one essential part for one year. I have done much in these twenty days and I hope I can do better in next twenties. I think I can plan and control my time in more effective way because actually I have wasted much time in this twenty days.</p>

Water quenches thirst for growth</code></pre><p>By Fang Aiqing in Beijing and Hu Dongmei in Pengyang, Ningxia | China Daily | Updated: 2020-06-13 09:14<br> Over the past decade, Ningxia has been prioritizing the resolution to provide rural areas with safe drinking water. Reliable supply transforms once barren area into a hive of productivity and profit.</p>
<p>With the help of automation and smart technology, residents of one of China’s driest areas are getting affordable clean water instead of yearning for rainfall.</p>
<p>It took people living in the central and south of Ningxia Hui autonomous region nearly 40 years to complete this arduous journey.</p>
<p>“In the past, we had to pour the water into the jar and let it settle before drinking it,” says Li Xiaoqin, a villager at Chengyang village of Pengyang county in the southeast of the autonomous region.<br>Zhang Shixiang, Party secretary of the village, says they used to carry water two kilometers to home, and it took two hours just to get the water.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have drinking water, let alone water to shower,” Li says, adding that they now have tap water not only to drink and shower, but also to clean the house, water the flowers, feed livestock, and importantly, flush the toilet.<br> Experts from the Ministry of Water Resources visit Pengyang county in the southeast of the autonomous region. </p>
<p>Today, the nearly 200,000 people living in the countryside of Pengyang, can, through phone access, check water quality and pay fees. Crucially, water charges are the same as those for townsfolk.</p>
<p>The southern mountainous area of the autonomous region, including where the county is located, is often referred to as Xihaigu.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, it was a dry and rainless place where barren hills stretched on and on and ravines and gullies crisscrossed. Groundwater was scarce.</p>
<p>Water resource per capita was less than one-sixth of the average amount nationwide, according to Jiang Qi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and director of the institute for desertification control at the Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences.</p>
<p>Scarcity of water had once been a constraint for the region’s high-quality development, he says.<br>A regional government document on poverty alleviation released in September 2016 shows that rain-fed farming accounted for 90 percent of total farmlands in underdeveloped areas of the autonomous region, and 80 percent of the cultivated land yielded not much and unsteadily.</p>
<p>Yet, annual rainfall of the county ranges from 350 to 550 millimeters, around one-third of the amount of evaporation, and rainfall from July through September takes up more than 60 percent of the whole year, making the situation in other seasons even worse, according to a government introduction of Pengyang’s natural geographic features.</p>
<p>However, with a stable water source now, the locals are actively planting red plum apricots (a local specialty), pepper, edible mushrooms and Chinese medical herbs, and also raising chickens, bees, cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>Niu Detan, general manager of the county’s water supply management company, says some locals who used to work outside have come back to run breeding businesses, or operate greenhouses and plant orchards.</p>
<p>People’s income is growing every year, Niu says.<br>All this is thanks to a water transfer project that makes it possible for more than one million people of the Xihaigu area to access safe drinking water since 2016.</p>
<p>The project transfers water from the Jinghe River by the east foot of the Liupan Mountain in southern Ningxia. The river is a tributary of the Weihe River, which, itself, is a tributary of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Based on the project, the county government of Pengyang invested further to integrate updated internet technology specially to improve the quality and stability of water supply in rural areas.</p>
<p>Zhang admitted that facilities didn’t work well at first and water quality was not satisfying.<br>The county later transformed the facilities in the reservoir, the pump station and the pipe network, and equipped every household with smart water meters, which enables real-time video monitoring of the whole water supply process, as well as remote control and management on computer and phone.</p>
<p>The water management staff can monitor the PH value and turbidity of the water online. Once there’s a breakdown, the system would automatically sound the alarm and distribute maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>According to Niu, if there were a communication failure at the pump station, the system inside the station would be able to supply water steadily for at least a week.</p>
<p>The intelligent facilities have solved the problem of high cost and management difficulty caused by rural households being numerous but scattered, Jiang says.</p>
<p>Therefore, water fees are lowered in these underdeveloped villages where pipelines have to go through mountains and ditches.</p>
<p>As Ningxia has already built a unified online platform before to manage water conservancy information, and facilities to provide internet access for rural areas, the county doesn’t have to invest much on internet infrastructure for the transformation such as server and the machine room, nor the data operation and security issues, according to Niu.<br>Over the past decade, Ningxia has been prioritizing the resolution to provide rural areas with safe drinking water. Tap water penetration has risen from 26 percent at the end of 2006 to 90 percent by 2019.</p>
<p>“We have historically solved the problem of water shortage and covered the barren hills with green,” says Ma Hancheng, vice-chairman of the autonomous region and a deputy to the National People’s Congress at a recent interview with chinanews.com.<br>Ningxia is now seeking to promote the intelligent water supply facilities of Pengyang to the whole region and is determined to provide replicable and referential experience for the country, where freshwater resource is much limited and distributes unevenly.<br>The region is calling for more financial and policy support from the country, according to a recent proposal from the region’s water conservancy department.</p>

<h2 id="Commentary"><a href="#Commentary" class="headerlink" title="Commentary"></a>Commentary</h2><p>Problem of water scarcity<br>Residents of some areas of China are yearning for rainfall, people don’t have water to support their basic lives, linking to the concept scarcity which means the state of being scarce or in short supply or shortage, they can’t get affordable clean water. I need to explore the causes of the issue and before I discuss whether automation and smart technology is an effective and sustainable way to solve the problem of water scarcity.</p>
<p>In one of China’s driest areas is lack of water and it also means the this area face a<br>shortage which means situation in which something needed cannot to b obtained in sufficient amounts. In this area, it extremely lacks underground water and rain. It took people living in the central and south of Ningxia Hui autonomous region nearly 40 years to complete this arduous journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/18/Ugl3b8.png" alt="Ugl3b8.png"></p>
<p>From Fig1, we can see that because of the population increases, the demand for water also expands as water is a kind of necessities，so demand curve shifts to the right. However, this place is rain less, so the supply of water decreases, so the supply curve shifts to the left, this will cause a gap between the Qd and Qs, this means the shortage of water and there is a tendency of price rising.</p>
<p>There exists the necessity for government to intervene and why we use this method, how to use this method and the disadvantages of this method. This problem of scarcity of water need to be solved because water is a kind of necessities, and people use tap water not only to drink and shower, but also to clean the house, water the flowers, feed livestock, and importantly, flush the toilet. If people’s necessities cannot be satisfied, they may have low level of living standard. In this way, this will increase the poverty of this area and the country which means the state of being extremely poor. So if we use automation and smart technology to solve the problem of water scarcity, people in poor areas can use water in their daily life and they can also use water to grow crops in order to support their living expenses, so their economic well-being will increase which is defined as having present and future financial security.</p>
<p>From the graph, we can see the change of the demand and supply curve. The demand curve doesn’t change because water is a kind of necessities, and people’s demand is stable. The supply curve shifts to the right because the automation and smart technology helps transports water to the area.<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/18/UglWx1.png" alt="UglWx1.png"></p>
<p>Then, I want to discuss how to use this method. In order to solve the problem of scarcity, the meaning of using this system is to transport the water from places in the south where water is very sufficient to the places where water is really scarce. However, the facilities to solve the water problem is really expensive and difficult to build. From the news, we can get that that area used 40 years to operate the system properly. So, we can get that it took so long time to operate the systems. In addition, the cost of using this system is very high. This is due to that the water fees in poor areas are lower than other areas because government in order to reduce the poverty. However, the facilities to solve the water problem is really expensive and difficult to build.</p>
<p>However, the method which uses automation and smart technology to solve the water problem has many disadvantages. Ignoring the disadvantages which are mentioned in the fourth paragraph, we will talk about the results the after using this method. The most significant one is that the quality of water can’t be guaranteed, and the stability of water is not very high. As a result, people may face the problem that the quality of water is very low, and this will lead people to have health problems and low stability will cause the living conditions of people to be influenced.</p>
<p> As a result, I need to discuss how to solve the issue of this method. If government wants to popularize the technology<br> and use it in different areas in the country, it needs a long time and huge amount of money. If government wants to<br> improve the quality and stability of water, this will use more time and money. In order to solve this problem, the only<br> way is to solve this problem is to give more money. As a result, this is link to the government revenue, definitely<br> government will give money. However, government may have to move money from other areas to solve water<br> scarcity，this will have an opportunity cost and government may have to increase the tax in order to increase the<br> government revenue. As a result, this is related to the government policies，government need to change policies to<br> achieve the aim.</p>
<p>In long run, using automation and smart technology to solve this problem isn’t a sustainable solution. Although we can solve some certain areas’ issues of water scarcity, we need to use very arduous ways. In fact, government can’t have so much money in a short time ，how much more the method use so much money has so many drawbacks. In conclusion, government needs to find more effective ways.</p>

        <p>I would like to describe an experience which I went to the Ming Tomb Museum to have the volunteer test. This was the first time I had a volunteer test.</p>
<p>I want to record this experience because this experience was really special for me. Before entering the senior school, I have never had a so professional test for volunteer and this was the first time, I knew that to be a volunteer have so many requirements.  The teachers in the museum told us to recite explanatory words and talked these contents to the visitors.</p>
<p>This was really a big challenge for me, this was the first time I try to recite the words. At the that moment, I just entered the senior high school and I haven’t adapted the pace of life in the school and I was very busy at that time, I have to cope with the study and also different kinds of activities .As a result, I hardly find any time to recite  the articles as I was so tired very day. In addition, I didn’t know the stories and history very clearly, it was very difficult for me to remember them in a very short time.</p>
<p>I tried it very hard to recite it, but I couldn’t find so much time to do so. I recited for so long time until late in the night before I had to go to there have the test. I was afraid that I couldn’t pass the test. However, I still have one hope that the test may be not so strict, but I thought wrong, the teacher was so harsh, she let me to repeat the articles for several times and she seemed that wasn’t satisfied with me. I felt that I couldn’t pass it successfully and I was so nervous. However, the teacher  then said to me surprised me a lot .She said that this test was to be responsible for the visitors and we have to make sure that the stories we told to visitors were correct and we also have to make sure that the visitors’ experience was good,  in this way ,volunteers should have the etiquettes and the professional knowledge to make sure the visitors to have the good impression, she said that she have saw my efforts and she also said that I have to practice it for more times. I was so surprised that I have the test and I also understand and remember some ideas that I have known for the first time.</p>
<p>Through this test, I recites these articles not only for myself, I thought these knowledge was no importance for me , but I have known that this was for the visitors , to be a volunteer , not only to gain an award for myself but also to gain the happiness through bringing others good experience and knowledge. The main idea to be a volunteer is to experience the sharedness to others, the reward is not important at all. So, I will treat the volunteer work more seriously, I have practiced the articles for several times, I want to record memories of my volunteer work and the happiness I told others useful and interesting stories.</p>
