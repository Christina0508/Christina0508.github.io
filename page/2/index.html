<p>title: 数学之美第二章读书笔记<br>date: 2020-05-24 20:43:46<br>tags: 数学之美第二章读书笔记<br>— ——自然语言处理<br>字母，文字，数字都是编码单位。一种语言就是一种编码的方式，语法就是解编码的算法。语言的数学本质就是通过编码来表达信息。虽说动物也能传递信息，但是直邮人类利用语言传递信息是人类的本质。随着计算机的出现，机器也可以用人类的方式处理和传递语言。智能就是人和机器交流，当人能够和机器交流时，说明这个机器就是智能了。</p>
<p>许多的科学家认为机器能够翻译或者识别等人类做的事，首先是要了解人类语言，而这一点是错误的，是因为计算机能够解释和做人类做的事，全都是因为数学，数学中的统计。而我们计算机语言的核心就是能够理解语法规则，就是对自然语言的处理。分析句子的文法被科学家用做规则来书写。所以高级程序语言的规则和自然语言的规则看上去很相似。然后人们分析更复杂的句子就要用从一维变成二维了，我们无法将图画出来，所以单纯对语言分析器已经无法分析这么复杂的语句了。但是即使写出所有自然语言对合集也无法用计算机来表示所有。即使是很规则的方法也不能分析一些真实语句。</p>
<p>自然界中很多的多义词很难用规则来描述，这就是计算机对难处，很多的意思依赖于上下文，或者常识。于是便从规则到了统计，用统计的办法使计算机的识别率大大提高。基于同统计的方法只能浅层次的理解自然语言，而无法从深层次研究。由于计算机能力的提高和数据量的增加，渐渐的分析复杂句子变成了可能，大家发现运用统计得到的句法比语言学家总结的更加的有道理。所以用数学处理自然语言。而科学家的新老交替才带来了发展。所以数学意模型和通讯是相通的，科学家们花了几十年来理解期中的联系。</p>

<p>title:  数学之美第一章读书笔记<br>date: 2020-05-16 13:49:28<br>tags:  第一章读书笔记<br>一开始拿到这本书的时候，数学之美，我的第一反应可能是对于数学的学术的研究，也有可能是对数学定理的解释，我先阅读了序言部分，对于序言部分，这本书主要写了作者对于数学以及信息处理方面的专业学科的理解，是一本深入浅出的书，既照顾了普通读者的兴趣又兼顾了专业读者对深度的要求。这样的介绍让我对这本书学之美有了初步的认识。对于书的前言部分，首先是刷新我对于这本书的认识，因为数学是一个神秘的学科，但是书中提出了数学是十分真实的，因为数学的演化过程实际是将我们生活中遇到的具体事物及其运动的规律不断抽象化的过程。数学并不是在现实中无法运用的，也并不是我们想象中的木讷二十我们生活中经常可以得以运用的，生活中的数学无处不在，我们日常使用的产品都有数学的存在。数学和语言通信也就是信息息息相关。因为要用数学解决和信息相关的许多内容，这就是数学之美。从古至今，通信无处不在，充斥着整个世界，不论是现在的人们离不开网络还是古代的人与人之间的基本交流，都受着数学规律的支配。虽然数学看起来很深奥但是实际上是简单而直接的，所以这本书主要是说简单即是美，来讲述数学之美。</p>
<p>数学，文字和自然语言都是信息的载体，他们之有着天然的联系。这是我之前所未能想到的，我一直不觉得语言和数学有什么联系，所以，语言和数学是为了同一目的，记录和传播信息。当我们在古代时就已经传播信息了，哪怕只是奇怪是叫声，也是信息的一种类型。语言只是因为越来越多的信息产生而出现。那么文字和数学之间的联系呀是十分奇妙的，文字的出现只是为了高效的记录信息。文字的发展是随着信息量的增加而产生的，所以也就可以解释为什么甲骨文发展成为现代的汉字，而在今日，在古代很长一段时间所不能完成的事情，现在在很短的时间里就可以处理很大数量的文字，因为有了不同型号的计算机。为什么我们能够理解古代的文字是因为文字是不重要的，重要的是信息本身。所以得出的结论是我们用不同的语言是为了保护信息的安全，因为用不同的语言，解释同一件事才能够让更加增进我们的理解，也许可以用一种语言解释另外一种。所以现代是同样的道理，不需要像古代一样繁琐的原因是我们有了更先进的数学工具和计算机。记数系统的产生仅仅是因为需要记数的物品越来越多，而记数系统的基础是数学。而我们使用十进制仅仅是因为人有十根手指，早期的人们是用掰手指来记数的。而我们使用阿拉伯数字是因为这种方法比中国人发明的个十百千万和罗马数字来的方便。而文字背后的数学是人们懒惰的使用不同的字母比使用象形文字来的方便，也就是现在的拼音文字。而古代的校验方法和现代与是相同的，只不过在表达上比一起更准确和丰富。今日我们的学者在研究自然语言时已经自发的在外面祖先设计语言之处用类似的方法解决现在的问题。古代和现代的相似之处有着的共同的东西就是数学规律。</p>

        <p>​    Talk about my biggest academic achievement ,I’d like to describe an exam in my junior high school which I ranked the twentieth among eight hundred students in my school.</p>
<p>​    As Chinese tradition,to be a good student , the most important thing is getting high marks in the exams,that is because in China,the end of the junior high school exams are the only and the most important factor for the entrance of senior high school.In this way, at that time for me the most important thing is to get high marks in the exams and my dream is of course is to do well in the exams and get into a good senior high school.</p>
<p>​    I’d like to talk about one of the mid-term exams.Before that exam,I did very bad in some previous exams,that makes me feel afraid of that exam.I could not come up with the answer why I couldn’t get high marks in the exams.During that period,I felt annoyed about myself.Why I make low level mistakes frequently?I worked very hard ,but I just couldn’t’t stop myself from making stupid mistakes.I thought that I couldn’t overcome that time.In this way,I felt even nervous when the exam was going to begin.I found that my heart speed up and just like there was a deer running fast in my heart.When the teacher came into the classroom, I even felt my hand which held the pen was trembling.I was afraid that I would get a bad mark again.</p>
<p>​    I needed to calm down,so I just told myself to calm down and I could achieve the goal and I could get high marks.I repeated these words in my heart and tried to give myself confidence.This way helped me and I calm down slowly and decided to try my best during the exam.That was the maths exam and I had make a lot of stupid mistakes in maths exam.I could work out the hard question, but I just went wrong in simple questions.So this time,I tried very hard and reminded myself to be careful and calm down many times.I thought that I put all my energy on that exam and i felt a stone in my heart went down and I was tired out when the exam finished.</p>
<p>​    Luckily,I got a high mark in that exams and I have a high rank.However,I don’t think that that success was because of my fortune and I also don’t want to say that success was because of my efforts.Admittedly,my efforts was one of the factor,but the most essential factor was the confidence.Through this success, I have learned that the only problem was in my heart.I wanted to get a good result in a haste and this made me made too many simple mistakes.Another reason is that I was not confident enough,because of the previous failure and I even couldn’t believe that I have the capacity to get success in the exams .</p>
<p>​    I thought this was my biggest academic achievement not because I have got a good rank and high marks in that exams.In fact, this was only a small exam,as it was not important and cannot decide my future and make small influence to me.However,during that event,I have found the weakness of my study life and I could not overcome it for a long time.That was the first time I have beat it.So this have told me that I could overcome it, and nothing is possible if i try and find a right method.Although I haven’t beat it forever and in fact I have met such similar occasions for many times since I got success in that exam.I thought that was due to my own personality and one ‘s personality is not easy to change.But this does not matter at all, i could try over and over again,i could overcome it forever in the future someday because definitely I will find an appropriate and effective way.</p>

        <p>​    I had that project in the November of 2019.That project was a competition in fact, the competition was China Thinks Big.If we can get into the 10% of the whole country, we would be able to show our project in Shanghai.</p>
<p>​    Our team set up very late.I was the leader of our team.Some of my classmates had set up their team about one month earlier than our team.This was because the final time of setting up was about one month later than the first time.We didn’t made up our mind to do this project at very first.We wasted a lot of time to decide.This had caused us to lack of time to prepare our reports and research.At first, we set up team, but some time later, we had a difficulty deciding our title and the contents.We only have decided to do searches about psychology.However, we can’t decide wht certain title and extends we would research.In this way, we had different ideas and this cause friction between our team members.Luckily,we discussed about one afternoon,we finally synthesize the ideas we all, we have decided our title, it was wether negative emotions will cause high school students have social problems.This is related to ourselves.So, it may be easier for us to have researches.</p>
<p>​    Then, the problems we faced was the time nearly used up because we started late.So, it’s really serious for us to finish a report a very short time.The most shortest time was we have to finish one report in just one week.At first, we did very earnest,we wrote one report after discussing for a long time and we will ask our teachers to modificate for us,then we can submit it.However, later, we could only discuss for one time,then we have submit it.Although we discussed very earnestly, I thought we have a lot of extents can be improved.I was the leader of my team, but i found that this was really a tiring work.I had to remind my team members over and over again.They may not finish their work very effectively.I also had to read and modificate the articles the wrote.I even had to accept their low quality work.I couldn’t blame them for their halfheartedness,because I didn’t want this to influence our friendship.</p>
<p>​    However, later, I have thought myself, I soon realized that, even I was very tired, i have pay much for our team, my team members even didn’t noticed that at all.They couldn’t admit my efforts .In this way, I had done self-examination about my leader work.I thought that a leader may be should have prestige,I didn’t need to care about the friendship, because in the team, I was the leader.But in the daily life, i could also be a good friend, these are just two different things.I couldn’t put them together, so in some extends, although I did a lot of efforts , I wasn’t a good leader.Though this project,I have realized that the next time to be a leader where i should improve.</p>
<p>​    Another thing i have learned that it was before I started to do something, I have to make a research and decided my mind early.How to make up mind early?i have to learn carefully about the activity,I should be careful to the time and comments.Then, i have to estimate whether I need to do it, whether I have enough time to finish it carefully , what can I learn from this activity.This is really important.</p>
<p>​    Although this time my project failed, but I don’t that this worth nothing for me.In contrast, this project have gave me a lot of experience and the things I need to improve.So, in some extents, failure is a good teacher.</p>

        <p>​    Today，I just want to summarize this IELTS study life this week.I have already finished my IELTS lessons,I thought that although I have finished study, but I have to do more exercises to prepare for my tests.</p>
<p>​    As I am in the special time(as we all know that the novel coronavirus has broke out, so I have started my online study life.In this way, I have a liberty of my time, for example,I could do many extra exercises or prepare for my IELTS during the breaks.This week, I have realized that vocabularies are really important for my study, not only IELTS but also my IGCSE study.I have been in Jinling high school for one term, my vocabulary has increased a lot, I also tried to memorized the vocabularies regularly under the instructions of my teachers.However, when I did a lot of exercises, I have realized that my vocabulary was really poor, this was also a reason that I couldn’t overcome the challenges and got high marks in the IELTS mock exam.So I have determined my mind to recite words every day.I have one vocabulary book, although I had that bok since the beginning of this term.I haven’t had one plan to recite it regularly.I made up my plan carefully and I decided to execute since that day.</p>
<p>​    However, I found that it really not a easy thing to do.During the first two days , I could execute my plan successfully and I thought that it will really helpful for my study, I was full of confidence and passion.Until the third day, i found that I found this work was really boring and I hadn’t find ang help and I thought that my efforts and time was just wasted , because I haven’t had any effects that can be showed on my homework or on the exercise I did.I nearly have no courage to preservers in my plan.Moreover, I not only faced this challenge but also another challenge .I found that I coudn’t memorize the words I have recited.When I saw the words I recited yesterday,I couldn’t remember them, I just remenber that I have recited them , but I couldn’t remenber their menings.In this way, I had to review them over and over again,because I forgot them over and over ang in.I found that it really a frustrating thing,I thought that this deeply hit my confidence.</p>
<p>​    I was always a unyielding person, so I wanted to realise the target I set when I began my plan.In this way,the time i used far more beyond the time I set at the beginning,because I used a lot of time to review the words i have recited.However,yesterday I suddenly realized that I have recited a lot of pages ,I have really remembered a lot of words.</p>
<p>​    This was only a small summary of my this week’s IELTS study,I thought that I thought this was a rough process and I felt that I didn’t pay any attention to my achievements, I found that it was really difficult during the process ,I once have an intention to give up.I think that preserverance is really essential, if one person can persevere one thing,even is a simple thing, if he can do it for a long term, it will definitely reach an aim or can get some achievements.Another thing, i should do things with a clear plan, a plan will actually help me finish and get targets more effective.</p>

        <p>​    Some people believe that young people who commit serious crimes should be punished in the same way as adults. To what extent do you agree or disagree?<br>Nowadays,there are some young people who commit crimes.There is a huge controversy on weather we should punish them in the same way as adults.From my perspective,I agree that we shouldn’t punish them in the same as adults.<br>​    Admitedly,punishing young people as the same as adults has positive effects because this can help them learn a lesson.As the way to punish adults is too serious, this can make them bear in mind.In this way, young children won’t make same mistakes again.As a result,they will learn and behave.<br>​    However,punishing them as adults will bring more problems than benefits.As young people’s mind and body haven’t developed maturely.So serious punishments can may produce negative effects to them, this may cause them to have psychological shadow.In this way,these experiences may influence their development.There are many felonies in the prison, so it will be easy for young people to recommit in the future.As a result,it will be difficult for young people to rehabilitate in the future.<br>Although there’re some positive sides for punishing young as adults, there will be more negative effects in fact.From my perspective,we shouldn’t treating young people who commit as adults.</p>
