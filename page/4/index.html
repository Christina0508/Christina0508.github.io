            <p>​    I had that project in the November of 2019.That project was a competition in fact, the competition was China Thinks Big.If we can get into the 10% of the whole country, we would be able to show our project in Shanghai.</p>
<p>​    Our team set up very late.I was the leader of our team.Some of my classmates had set up their team about one month earlier than our team.This was because the final time of setting up was about one month later than the first time.We didn’t made up our mind to do this project at very first.We wasted a lot of time to decide.This had caused us to lack of time to prepare our reports and research.At first, we set up team, but some time later, we had a difficulty deciding our title and the contents.We only have decided to do searches about psychology.However, we can’t decide wht certain title and extends we would research.In this way, we had different ideas and this cause friction between our team members.Luckily,we discussed about one afternoon,we finally synthesize the ideas we all, we have decided our title, it was wether negative emotions will cause high school students have social problems.This is related to ourselves.So, it may be easier for us to have researches.</p>
<p>​    Then, the problems we faced was the time nearly used up because we started late.So, it’s really serious for us to finish a report a very short time.The most shortest time was we have to finish one report in just one week.At first, we did very earnest,we wrote one report after discussing for a long time and we will ask our teachers to modificate for us,then we can submit it.However, later, we could only discuss for one time,then we have submit it.Although we discussed very earnestly, I thought we have a lot of extents can be improved.I was the leader of my team, but i found that this was really a tiring work.I had to remind my team members over and over again.They may not finish their work very effectively.I also had to read and modificate the articles the wrote.I even had to accept their low quality work.I couldn’t blame them for their halfheartedness,because I didn’t want this to influence our friendship.</p>
<p>​    However, later, I have thought myself, I soon realized that, even I was very tired, i have pay much for our team, my team members even didn’t noticed that at all.They couldn’t admit my efforts .In this way, I had done self-examination about my leader work.I thought that a leader may be should have prestige,I didn’t need to care about the friendship, because in the team, I was the leader.But in the daily life, i could also be a good friend, these are just two different things.I couldn’t put them together, so in some extends, although I did a lot of efforts , I wasn’t a good leader.Though this project,I have realized that the next time to be a leader where i should improve.</p>
<p>​    Another thing i have learned that it was before I started to do something, I have to make a research and decided my mind early.How to make up mind early?i have to learn carefully about the activity,I should be careful to the time and comments.Then, i have to estimate whether I need to do it, whether I have enough time to finish it carefully , what can I learn from this activity.This is really important.</p>
<p>​    Although this time my project failed, but I don’t that this worth nothing for me.In contrast, this project have gave me a lot of experience and the things I need to improve.So, in some extents, failure is a good teacher.</p>

            <p>​    Today，I just want to summarize this IELTS study life this week.I have already finished my IELTS lessons,I thought that although I have finished study, but I have to do more exercises to prepare for my tests.</p>
<p>​    As I am in the special time(as we all know that the novel coronavirus has broke out, so I have started my online study life.In this way, I have a liberty of my time, for example,I could do many extra exercises or prepare for my IELTS during the breaks.This week, I have realized that vocabularies are really important for my study, not only IELTS but also my IGCSE study.I have been in Jinling high school for one term, my vocabulary has increased a lot, I also tried to memorized the vocabularies regularly under the instructions of my teachers.However, when I did a lot of exercises, I have realized that my vocabulary was really poor, this was also a reason that I couldn’t overcome the challenges and got high marks in the IELTS mock exam.So I have determined my mind to recite words every day.I have one vocabulary book, although I had that bok since the beginning of this term.I haven’t had one plan to recite it regularly.I made up my plan carefully and I decided to execute since that day.</p>
<p>​    However, I found that it really not a easy thing to do.During the first two days , I could execute my plan successfully and I thought that it will really helpful for my study, I was full of confidence and passion.Until the third day, i found that I found this work was really boring and I hadn’t find ang help and I thought that my efforts and time was just wasted , because I haven’t had any effects that can be showed on my homework or on the exercise I did.I nearly have no courage to preservers in my plan.Moreover, I not only faced this challenge but also another challenge .I found that I coudn’t memorize the words I have recited.When I saw the words I recited yesterday,I couldn’t remember them, I just remenber that I have recited them , but I couldn’t remenber their menings.In this way, I had to review them over and over again,because I forgot them over and over ang in.I found that it really a frustrating thing,I thought that this deeply hit my confidence.</p>
<p>​    I was always a unyielding person, so I wanted to realise the target I set when I began my plan.In this way,the time i used far more beyond the time I set at the beginning,because I used a lot of time to review the words i have recited.However,yesterday I suddenly realized that I have recited a lot of pages ,I have really remembered a lot of words.</p>
<p>​    This was only a small summary of my this week’s IELTS study,I thought that I thought this was a rough process and I felt that I didn’t pay any attention to my achievements, I found that it was really difficult during the process ,I once have an intention to give up.I think that preserverance is really essential, if one person can persevere one thing,even is a simple thing, if he can do it for a long term, it will definitely reach an aim or can get some achievements.Another thing, i should do things with a clear plan, a plan will actually help me finish and get targets more effective.</p>
